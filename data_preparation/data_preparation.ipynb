Fuzzy logic is the same apart from you can have truth values that are in-between true and false, that is to say, you are working with any number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (inclusive). The fact that you can have a \\'partially true and partially false\\' truth value is where the word &quot;fuzzy&quot; comes from. Natural languages often use fuzzy logic like &quot;that balloon is red&quot; meaning that balloon could be any colour that is similar enough to red, or &quot;the shower is warm&quot;. Here is a rough diagram for how &quot;the temperature of the shower is warm&quot; could be represented in terms of fuzzy logic (the y axis being the true value and the x-axis being the temperature):</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/G7szY.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/G7szY.png\" alt=\"y-axis=truth value of statement about temperature, x-axis=temperature\" /></a></p>\\n<p>Fuzzy logic can be applied to boolean operations such as <strong>and</strong>, <strong>or</strong>, and <strong>not</strong>. Note that you can define the fuzzy logic operations in different ways. One way is with the min and max functions which return the lesser most and greater most values of the two values inputted respectively. This would work as such:</p>\\n<pre><code>A and B = min(A,B)\\nA or B  = max(A,B)\\nnot A   = 1-A\\n(where A and B are real values from 0 (inclusive) to 1 (inclusive))\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>When defined like this they are called the <strong>Zadeh operators</strong>.</p>\\n<p>Another way would be to define <strong>and</strong> as the first argument times the second argument, which yields different outputs for the same inputs as the Zadeh <strong>and</strong> operator (<code>min(0.5,0.5)=0.5, 0.5*0.5=0.25</code>). Then other operators are derived based on the <strong>and</strong> and <strong>not</strong> operators. This would work as such:</p>\\n<pre><code>A and B = A*B\\nnot A = 1-A\\nA or B = not ((not A) and (not B)) = 1-((1-A)*(1-B)) = 1-(1-A)*(1-B)\\n(where A and B are real values from 0 (inclusive) to 1 (inclusive))\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>You can then use the three &quot;basic fuzzy logic operations&quot; to build all other &quot;fuzzy logic operations&quot;, just like you can use the three &quot;basic boolean operations&quot; to build all other &quot;boolean logic operations&quot;.</p>\\n<p>Sources:\\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Fuzzy logic wikipedia</a>,\\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Boolean algebra wikipedia</a>,\\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r804UF8Ia4c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Explanation of fuzzy logic on Youtube</a></p>\\n<p>Note: if anyone could suggest some more reliable sources in the comments, I will happily add them to the list (I understand that the current ones aren\\'t too reliable).</p>\\n<p>Edit: My bad, I confused different ways to define <em>different</em> operators in fuzzy logic with being different ways to define <em>the same</em> operators in fuzzy logic.</p>\\n'),\n",

Humankind would be unable to predict any future events, or explain any present events, as science itself becomes incapable of describing machine-triggered events. Essentially, machines would think of us the same way we think of ants. Thus, we can make no predictions past the singularity. Furthermore, as a logical consequence, we\\'d be unable to define the point at which the singularity may occur at all, or even recognize it when it happens.</p>\\n<p>However, in order for the singularity to take place, AGI needs to be developed, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#Feasibility\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">whether that is possible is quite a hot debate</a> right now. Moreover, an algorithm that creates <em>superhuman intelligence</em> (or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>superintelligence</em></a>) out of bits and bytes would have to be designed. By definition, a human programmer wouldn\\'t be able to do such a thing, as his/her brain would need to be able to comprehend concepts beyond its range. There is also the argument that an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#Intelligence_explosion\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>intelligence explosion</em></a> (the mechanism by which a technological singularity would theoretically be formed) would be impossible due to the difficulty of the design challenge of making itself more intelligent, getting larger proportionally to its intelligence, and that the difficulty of the design itself may overtake the intelligence required to solve the said challenge.</p>\\n<p>Also, there are related theories involving <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_takeover\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>machines taking over humankind</em></a> and all of that sci-fi narrative.

This they can indeed do: but then the second machine will have a Gödelian formula all of its own, constructed by applying Gödel's procedure to the formal system which represents its (the second machine's) own, enlarged, scheme of operations. And this formula the second machine will not be able to produce as being true, while a mind will be able to see that it is true. And if now a third machine is constructed, able to do what the second machine was unable to do, exactly the same will happen: there will be yet a third formula, the Gödelian formula for the formal system corresponding to the third machine's scheme of operations, which the third machine is unable to produce as being true, while a mind will still be able to see that it is true. And so it will go on.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>In short, by making the system more complex, it can see the inadequacy of a less complex system, but a yet more complex system can see its inadequacy. But from whence comes the claim that a mind <em>could</em> see the inadequacy in the <em>n</em>th machine? If, say, the Gödelian formula had as many components to it as a human brain had neurons, it seems suspect to claim that the human <em>could</em> evaluate that formula and identify that it is in fact a Gödelian formula, rather than a similar but not quite identical sentence.  </p>\\n\"),\n",

The language most commonly used today is python.</p>\\n\\n<p>Relevant answers:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Stack Overflow thread explaining why LISP was thought of as the AI language: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/130475/why-is-lisp-used-for-ai\">Why is Lisp used for AI</a></li>\\n<li>Quora answer by Peter Norvig, who wrote a popular textbook on the subject and is currently Director of Research at Google: <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-Lisp-is-highly-used-programming-language-in-AI\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Is it true that Lisp is highly used programming language in AI?</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>LISP pioneered many important concepts in what we now call functional programming, with a key attraction being how close the programs were to math. Many of these features have since been incorporated into modern languages (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Wikipedia page</a>). LISP is very expressive: it has very little syntax (just lists and some elementary operations on them) but you can write short succinct programs that represent complex ideas. This amazes newcomers and has sold it as the language for AI. However, this is a property of programs in general. Short programs can represent complex concepts. And while you can write powerful code in LISP, any beginner will tell you that it is also very hard to read anyone else\\'s LISP code or to debug your own LISP code. Initially, there were also performance considerations with functional programming and it fell out of favor to be replaced by low level imperative languages like C. (For example, functional programming requires that no object ever be changed (\"mutated\"), so every operation requires a new object to be created. Without good garbage collection, this can get unwieldy). Today, we\\'ve learned that a mix of functional and imperative programming is needed to write good code and modern languages like python, ruby and scala support both. At this point, and this is just my opinion, there is no reason to prefer LISP over python.</p>\\n\\n<p>The paradigm for AI that currently receives the most attention is Machine Learning, where we learn from data, as opposed to previous approaches like Expert Systems (in the 80s) where experts wrote rules for the AI to follow. Python is currently the most widely used language for machine learning and has many libraries, e.g. Tensorflow and Pytorch, and an active community. To process the massive amounts of data, we need systems like Hadoop, Hive or Spark. Code for these is written in python, java or scala. Often, the core time-intensive subroutines are written in C.</p>\\n\\n<p>The AI Winter of the 80s was not because we did not have the right language, but because we did not have the right algorithms, enough computational power and enough data. If you\\'re trying to learn AI, spend your time studying algorithms and not languages.</p>\\n'),\n",

The significance of the weights is that they make a linear transformation from the output of the previous layer and hand it to the node they are going to. To say it more simplistically, they specify how important (and in what way: negative or positive) is the activation of node they are coming from to activating the node they are going to.</p>\\n\\n<p>In your example, since there is only one layer (a row of input nodes and a row of output nodes) it is easy to explain what each node represents. However in multi-layer feedforward networks they can become abstract representations which makes it difficult to explain them and therefore explain what the weights that come to them or go out of them represent.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another way of thinking about it is that they describe hyperplanes in the space of the output of the previous node layer. If each output from the previous layer represents a point in space, a hyperplane decides which part of the space should give a positive value to the plane's corresponding node in the next layer and which part should give a negative input to it. It actually cuts that space into two halves. If you consider the input space of a multi-layer feedforward network, the weights of the first layer parametrize hyperplanes, however in the next layers they can represent non-linear surfaces in the input space.</p>\\n\"),\n",

              "               '<p>There\\'s no objective reason to state that declarative languages are better suited for AI development. However, there\\'s indeed a bias towards them in practice. Although most functional languages are impure (that is, they allow side effects), and such can\\'t count as \"declarative\", a few languages are purely functional (that is, they don\\'t allow side effects), most prominently <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming#Functional_programming\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Haskell</a>. Purity is key here. In Haskell, <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/4066401/5249858\">even I/O is pure</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>The key difference between imperative languages and (purely) functional languages is in the way they describe the program. An imperative program describes <em>how</em> to do stuff, that is, algorithms. It specifies the specific instructions that the machine must carry on in order to perform the computation. OTOH, purely functional languages describe <em>what</em> is to be computed, that is, the relationship between the input and the output. In mathematics, \"function\" is just a fancy name for a relationship between an input and an output.</p>\\n\\n<p>Again, in the mathematical sense, the only variability is that of the function\\'s arguments. That is, the function\\'s output depends solely on its input (arguments). This is known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">referential transparency</a>. Referential transparency states that:</p>\\n\\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$$\\n\\\\forall f \\\\in \\\\varphi, \\\\forall x \\\\in \\\\delta_f, fx = fx\\n$$</span></p>\\n\\n<p>Where <span class=\"math-container\">$\\\\varphi$</span> is the set of all functions, and <span class=\"math-container\">$\\\\delta_f$</span> is <span class=\"math-container\">$f$</span>\\'s domain. For the typical imperative language\\'s definition of \"function\", the above doesn\\'t hold. For instance, C\\'s <code>getchar()</code> does not always return the same value.</p>\\n\\n<p>Let\\'s say we want to calculate the set of the ten least prime numbers whose least significant digit is <span class=\"math-container\">$3$</span>. First, in mathematical notation:</p>\\n\\n<p><span class=\"math-container\">$$\\n\\\\mathbb{S} = \\\\mathbb{G}_{10} = \\\\{ x \\\\mid x \\\\in \\\\{ p \\\\mid p \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\setminus \\\\{0, 1 \\\\} \\\\text{ and } (\\\\forall q \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\setminus \\\\{0, 1, p \\\\}, p \\\\text{ mod } q = 0) \\\\},  x \\\\text{ mod } 10 = 3 \\\\}\\n$$</span></p>\\n\\n<p>Where <code>G(n, s)</code> is the set of the lesser <code>n</code>th elements from <code>s</code>. In mathematics, you don\\'t worry about how is the set <span class=\"math-container\">$\\\\mathbb{S}$</span> supposed to be computed, but rather about <span class=\"math-container\">$\\\\mathbb{S}$</span>\\'s definition itself.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, in Python (in imperative style):</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>def is_prime(n):\\n  for x in range(2, n):\\n    if n % x == 0:\\n      return False\\n\\n  return True\\n\\ndef foo():\\n  s = set()\\n  n = 2\\n  while len(s) &lt; 10:\\n    if is_prime(n) and n % 10 == 3:\\n       s.append(n)\\n\\n  return set(s)\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>In Python, we care about (and are responsible for) the algorithm being used to compute the set. We specify, pretty much in recipe-style, how to build the set from scratch. If there\\'s an algorithm that may be better suited for checking whether a number is prime or odd, but we don\\'t use it, it\\'s our fault, not Python\\'s.</p>\\n\\n<p>Finally, Haskell steps in:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>import qualified Data.Set as Set\\n\\nisPrime :: Integer -&gt; Bool\\nisPrime n = ( == 1 ) . length . filter ( == 0 ) . map ( n `mod` ) $ [ 2 .. n ]\\n\\ns = Set.fromList . take 10 . filter ( ( == 3 ) . ( `mod` 10 ) ) . filter isPrime $ [1..]\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Haskell\\'s version is a lot more like the mathematical model than Python is. We define the <code>isPrime</code> function in terms of the constraints that a prime number must obey, not by describing a step-by-step algorithm to do such a check. Moreover, <code>s</code> (the set we have been defining so far) is defined in terms of the constraints its members must obey, rather than in terms of an algorithm to compute <code>s</code> itself. The compiler, more often than not <a href=\"https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.8.3/docs/html/users_guide/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System</a> (a.k.a GHC), is the one responsible for generating an algorithm. GHC\\'s optimizer is known to be one of the strongest in the world, not because its the best compiler of \\'em all, but because Haskell\\'s nature allows for this.</p>\\n\\n<p>Haskell (and other functional languages), in summary, have several features that make it look, taste, and behave like pure math:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><p>Referential transparency and purity.</p></li>\\n<li><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Haskell is lazy</a>.</p></li>\\n<li><p><a href=\"https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/279316/what-exactly-makes-the-haskell-type-system-so-revered-vs-say-java\">A <strong>very</strong> strong type system</a>, with such exotic (but very useful!) stuff as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_data_type\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">recursive</a> (and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">algebraic</a>) data types.</p></li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>So, the bottom line is that AI researchers often prefer functional languages over imperative languages (or, more assertively, pure over impure languages), because they are attempting to <em>define</em> artificial intelligence itself, by means of functions (relationship between an input and an output). At the end, we do this because we have no real algorithm for human-level intelligence to raise from a handful of transistors. Also, there\\'s been a historical bias towards these kind of languages, starting with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">John McCarthy</a>, Lisp\\'s creator and a pioneer in early AI research.</p>\\n'),\n",

There is still momentum due to so many people using it in the past, who are still active in the industry or research (anecdote: the last VCR was produced by a Japanese maker in July 2016, yes). The language is however used (to my knowledge) for the kind of AI that does not leverage Machine Learning, typically as the reference books from Russell and Norvig. These applications are still very useful, but Machine Learning gets all the steam these days.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another reason for the decline is that LISP practitioners have partially moved to Clojure and other recent languages.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you are learning about AI technologies, LISP (or Scheme or Prolog) is good choice to understand what is going on with \"AI\" at large. But if you wish or have to be very pragmatic, Python or R are the community choices</p>\\n\\n<p>Note: The above lacks concrete example and reference. I am aware of some work in universities, and some companies inspired by or directly using LISP.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>To add on @Harsh\\'s answer, LISP (and Scheme, and Prolog) has qualities that made it look like it was better suited for creating intelligent mechanisms---making AI as perceived in the 60s.</p>\\n\\n<p>One of the qualities was that the language design leads the developer to think in a quite elegant way, to decompose a big problem into small problems, etc. Quite \"clever\", or \"intelligent\" if you will. Compared to some other languages, there is almost no choice but to develop that way. LISP is a list processing language, and \"purely functional\".</p>\\n\\n<p>One problem, though, can be seen in work related to LISP. A notable one in the AI domain is the work on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_calculus\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Situation Calculus</a>, where (in short) one describes objects and rules in a \"world\", and can let it evolve to compute <em>situations</em>---states of the world. So it is a model for reasoning on situations. The main problem is called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_problem\" rel=\"noreferrer\">frame problem</a>, meaning this calculus cannot tell what does <em>not</em> change---just what changes. Anything that is not defined in the world cannot be processed (note the difference here with ML). First implementations used LISPs, because that was the AI language then. And there were bound by the frame problem. But, as @Harsh mentioned, it is not LISP\\'s fault: Any language would face the same framing issue (a conceptual problem of the Situation Calculus).</p>\\n\\n<p>So the language really does not matter from the AI / AGI / ASI perspective. The concepts (algorithms, etc.) are really what matters.</p>\\n\\n<p>Even in Machine Learning, the language is just a practical choice. Python and R are popular today, primarily due to their library ecosystem and the focus of key companies. But try to use Python or R to run a model for a RaspberryPI-based application, and you will face some severe limitations (but still possible, I am doing it :-)). So the language choice burns down to pragmatism.</p>\\n'),\n",

A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Turing machine</a> consists of a finite state machine and an infinite tape. A Turing Machine does run an algorithm, determined by its initial state and the state transition matrix, but what I think you are talking about is Universal Turing Machines (UTM)  that can read \"code\" (which is usually a description of another Turing machine) written on a \"code segment\" of the tape and then simulate that machine on input data written on the \"data segment\" of the tape.</p>\\n\\n<p>Turing machines can differ in the number of states in their finite state machines (and also in the alphabet they write on the tape but any finite alphabet is easily encoded in binary so this should not be the big reason for differences among Turing machines). So, you can have UTMs with bigger state machines and UTMs with smaller state machines. The bigger UTM could possibly surpass the smaller one if they use the same encoding for the \"code\" part of the tape.</p>\\n\\n<p>You can also play around with the code used to describe the TM being simulated. This code could be C++, for example, or could be a Neural network with the synapse strength written down as a matrix. Which description is better for computation depends on the problem.</p>\\n\\n<p>An example comparison among UTMs with different state machines: consider different compilers for the same language, say C++. Both of them will first compile C++ to assembly and then run another UTM which reads and executes assembly (your physical CPU). So, a better compiler will run the same code faster.</p>\\n\\n<p>Back to humans vs computers, humans are neural networks that run algorithms like those you would write in C++. This involves a costly and inefficient conversion of the algorithm into hand movements. A computer uses a compiler to convert C++ to assembly that it can run natively, so it\\'s able to do a much more efficient implementation of C++ code. Alternately, humans have a ton of neurons, and the neural code, i.e. synapse strength, is hard to read, so current computers cannot run that code yet.</p>\\n'),\n",

Example: \\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>States = {<em>sleep</em>, <em>eat</em>, <em>walk</em>, <em>work</em>}</li>\\n<li>Model 1: Most probable sequence on weekdays, say: sleep → sleep → eat → walk → work → work → eat → walk → sleep  → sleep</li>\\n<li>Model 2: Most probable sequence on weekends, some: sleep → sleep → eat → walk → eat → walk → sleep → sleep</li>\\n<li>New data arrives: Which sequence is more probable that it came from? Check model 1, check model 2. Which fits better? → Assign</li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li>Note that the previous example is oversimplified. Also note that a <em>unit time</em> is needed there (other than letters / words, for instance).</li>\\n<li>You can <em>nest</em> Markov models. That means that you generate a model (a set of probabilities for all the states) in a \"lower scale\" and then use it in a more abstract model.

Most of our promising approaches deal with <em>avoiding damage</em> rather than <em>adding capabilities</em>--there\\'s no drug that you can take now that will make you smarter to the degree that missing a night of sleep can make you dumber.</p>\\n\\n<p>The most informative area of current practice is probably game-playing, where \\'<a href=\"http://bloomreach.com/2014/12/centaur-chess-brings-best-humans-machines/\">centaurs</a>,\\' or humans working with computers, outcompete human players or computer players.</p>\\n\\n<p>But a centaur player doesn\\'t have a wire jutting out of their skull to jack into the computer; they\\'re looking at a laptop screen. One of the reasons to be pessimistic about cyborg augmentation is because current I/O technology is already so good. Why install a new wire to put information into your visual cortex, when you come already equipped with two? </p>\\n\\n<p>If you could think code directly onto the screen, how much better would that be than typing code through a keyboard? Probably some, but I find it difficult to imagine that it\\'ll be more than twice as good. So most human-computer intelligence augmentation will look like people using software, and software using human inputs, rather than humans and computers evolving together.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (TDCS) and similar approaches cause temporary changes in mental abilities by raising or lowering the activation potentials of neurons in particular regions of the brain. (I\\'ve done it myself, a few years ago, and what weak effects I noticed were probably negative. Not too much surprise for a DIY setup!)</p>\\n\\n<p>It looks like it has a number of useful implications. One article about TDCS that I found particularly striking was the journalist who tried it gushing about how their anxiety disappeared for a few days, presumably because the part of their brain behind the anxiety was dampened. One could imagine it being useful for the treatment of many different mental disorders.</p>\\n\\n<p>That said, I\\'m pessimistic that it will translate into superior <em>peak</em> performance, and I think that\\'s the sort of thing that\\'s more relevant for discussions of augmentation. (Is there TDCS that we could do that would make Terrence Tao better at doing mathematics?)</p>\\n\\n<p>Where improved AI methods will come into play is by improving our models of the brain, allowing us to better target interventions, much in the way that AI methods are improving our treatment of cancer (through superior diagnosis and targeting of radiotherapy, as two easy examples). These effects will all be indirect--for example, AI empowering an app or gadget that helps you sleep better won\\'t <em>directly</em> augment your intelligence, but will cause population-level increases in effective intelligence through reducing sleep deprivation.</p>\\n\\n<p>I haven\\'t talked yet about nootropics, chemicals that increase intelligence, but it\\'s reasonable to expect that AI will improve drug discovery there like it improves drug discovery for anything else. But the same caveats apply--the effect of nootropics seem to be negatively correlated with intelligence (that is, the smarter someone already is, the harder it is to increase their intelligence further).</p>\\n'),\n",

              "               '<p>Evolutionary algorithms are a family of optimization algorithms based on the principle of <strong>Darwinian natural selection</strong>. As part of natural selection, a given environment has a population of individuals that compete for survival and reproduction. The ability of each individual to achieve these goals determines their chance to have children, in other words, to pass on their genes to the next generation of individuals, who, for genetic reasons, will have an increased chance of doing well, even better, in realizing these two objectives.</p>\\n<p>This principle of continuous improvement over the generations is taken by evolutionary algorithms to optimize solutions to a problem. In the <strong>initial generation</strong>, a population composed of different <strong>individuals</strong> is generated randomly or by other methods. An individual is a solution to the problem, more or less good: the quality of the individual in regards to the problem is called <strong>fitness</strong>, which reflects the adequacy of the solution to the problem to be solved. The higher the fitness of an individual, the higher it is likely to pass some or all of its genotype to the individuals of the next generation.</p>\\n<p>An individual is coded as a <strong>genotype</strong>, which can have any shape, such as a bit vector (<strong>genetic algorithms</strong>) or a vector of real (evolution strategies). Each genotype is transformed into a <strong>phenotype</strong> when assessing the individual, i.e. when its fitness is calculated. In some cases, the phenotype is identical to the genotype: it is called <strong>direct</strong> <strong>coding</strong>. Otherwise, the coding is called indirect. For example, suppose you want to optimize the size of a rectangular parallelepiped defined by its length, height and width. To simplify the example, assume that these three quantities are integers between 0 and 15. We can then describe each of them using a 4-bit binary number. An example of a potential solution may be to genotype 0001 0111 1010. The corresponding phenotype is a parallelepiped of length 1, height 7 and width 10.</p>\\n<p>During the transition from the old to the new generation, the <strong>variation</strong> <strong>operators</strong>, whose purpose is to manipulate individuals, are applied. There are two distinct types of variation operators:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>the <strong>mutation</strong> <strong>operators</strong>, which are used to introduce variations within the same individual, as genetic mutations;</li>\\n<li>the <strong>crossover</strong> <strong>operators</strong>, which are used to cross at least two different genotypes, as genetic crosses from breeding.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Evolutionary algorithms have proven themselves in various fields such as operations research, robotics, biology, nuance, or cryptography. In addition, they can optimize multiple objectives simultaneously and can be used as black boxes because they do not assume any properties in the mathematical model to optimize. Their only real limitation is the computational complexity.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wweBO.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wweBO.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\\n'),\n",

They seem to due a very good job of explaining what a genetic algorithm is. So, this will give an example.</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s say you have a neural network (although they are not the only application of it), which, from some given inputs, will yield some outputs. A genetic algorithm can create a population of these, and by seeing which output is the best, breed and kill off members of the population. Eventually, this should optimise the neural network if it is complicated enough.</p>\\n<p>Here is a demonstration I\\'ve made, which despite being badly coded, might help you understand. <a href=\"http://khrabanas.github.io/projects/evo/evo.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://khrabanas.github.io/projects/evo/evo.html</a>\\nHit the evolve button and mess around with the goals.</p>\\n<p>It uses a simple genetic algorithm to breed, mutate, and decide which individuals of the population survive. Depending on how the input variables are set, the network will be able to get to some level of closeness to them. In this fashion, the population will likely eventually become a homogeneous group, whose outputs resemble the goals.</p>\\n<p>The genetic algorithm is trying to create a &quot;neural network&quot; of sorts, that by taking in RGB, will yield an output color. First, it generates a random population. It then by taking 3 random members from the population, selecting the one with the lowest fitness and removing it from the population. The fitness is equal to the difference in the top goal squared + the difference in the bottom goal squared. It then breeds the two remaining ones together and adds the child to the same place in the population as the dead member. When mating occurs, there is a chance a mutation will occur. This mutation will change one of the values randomly.</p>\\n<p>As a side note, due to how it is set up, it is impossible for it to be totally correct in many cases, though it will reach relative closeness.</p>\\n'),\n",

Unfortunately it seems, this SE site does not support LaTex:</p>\\n\\n<p>Document summarization is very much an open problem in AI research. One way this task is currently handled is called \"extractive summarization\". The basic strategy is as follows: Split this document into sentences and we will present as a summary a subset of sentences which together cover all the important details in the post. Assign sentence $i$, $1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n$, a variable $z_i \\\\in \\\\{ 0, 1 \\\\}$, where $z_i = 1$ indicates the sentence was selected and $z_i = 0$ means the sentence was left out. Then, $z_i z_j = 1$ if and only if both sentences were chosen. We will also define the importance of each sentence $w_i$ for the sentence $i$ and interaction terms $w_{i,j}$ between sentences $i$ and $j$. </p>\\n\\n<p>Let $x_i$ be the feature vectors for sentence $i$. $w_i = w(x_i)$ captures how important it is to include this sentence (or the topics covered by it) while $w_{i,j} = w(x_i,x_j)$ indicates the amount of overlap between sentences in our summary. Finally we put all this in a minimization problem:</p>\\n\\n<p>\\\\begin{aligned} \\n\\\\underset{z_i}{\\\\text{maximize }} &amp; \\\\sum_{i} w_i z_i - w_{i,j} z_i z_j \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{s.t. } &amp; z_i = 0 \\\\text{ or } 1\\n\\\\end{aligned}</p>\\n\\n<p>This tries to maximize the total weight of the sentences covered and tries to minimize the amount of overlap. This is an integer programming problem similar to finding the lowest weight independent set in a graph and many techniques exist to solve such problems.</p>\\n\\n<p>This design, in my opinion, captures the fundamental problems in text summarization and can be extended in many ways. We will discuss those in a bit, but first, we need to completely specify the features $w$. $w_i = w(x_i)$ could be a function only of the sentence $i$, but it could also depends on the place of the sentence in the document or its context (Is the sentence at the beginning of a paragraph? Does it share common words with the title? What is its length? Does it mention any proper nouns? etc)</p>\\n\\n<p>$w_{i,j} = w(x_i,x_j)$ is a similarity measure. It measures how many repetitions there will be if we include both words in the sentence. It can be defined by looking at common words between sentences. We can also extract topics or concepts from each sentence and see how many are common among them, and use language features like pronouns to see if one sentence expands on another.</p>\\n\\n<p>To improve the design, first, we could do <em>keyphrase extraction</em>, i.e. identify key phrases in the text and choose to define the above problem in terms of those instead of trying to pick sentences. That is a similar problem to what Google does to summarize news articles in their search results, but I am not aware of the details of their approach. We could also break the sentences up further into concepts and try to establish the semantic meaning of the sentences ( Ponzo and Fila are people P1 and P2, a mall is a place P, P1 and P2 went to the place P at time T (day). Mode of transport walking.... and so on). To do this, we would need to use a semantic ontology or other common-sense knowledge databases. However, all the parts of this last semantic classification problem are open and I have not seen anyone make satisfactory progress on it yet. </p>\\n\\n<p>We could also tweak the loss function above so that instead of the setting the tradeoff between the sentence importance $w_i$ and the diversity score $w_{i,j}$ by hand, we could learn it from data. One way to do this is to use Conditional Random Fields to model the data, but many others surely exist.</p>\\n\\n<p>I hope this answer explained the basic problems that need to be solved to make progress towards good summarization systems. This is an active field of research and you will find the most recent papers via Google Scholar, but first read the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia page</a> to learn the relevant terms</p>\\n'),\n",

Thus, it may not have a high level view of the image since it only looks at patches, and images are usually downscaled to much lower resolution to obtain the results in current generation systems. Methods which look at how the components of the image interact may be able to avoid these problems.</p>\\n\\n<p>Some questions to ask for this work are: How confident were the networks when they made these predictions? How much volume do such adversarial images occupy in the space of all images?</p>\\n\\n<p>Some work I am aware of in this regard comes from Dhruv Batra and Devi Parikh\\'s Lab at Virginia Tech who look into this for question answering systems: <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07356v1.pdf\">Analyzing the Behavior of Visual Question Answering Models</a> and <a href=\"https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~dbatra/papers/gmpb_icmlvis16.pdf\">Interpreting Visual Question Answering models</a>. </p>\\n\\n<p>More such work is needed, and just as the human visual system does also get fooled by such \"optical illusions\", these problems may be unavoidable if we use DNNs, though AFAIK nothing is yet known either way, theoretically or empirically. </p>\\n'),\n",

              "               '<p>There are a number of good answers here explaining what genetic algorithms are, and giving example applications. I\\'m adding some general purpose advice on what they are good for, but also cases where you should NOT use them.</p>\\n<p>If my tone seems harsh, it is because using GAs in any of the cases in the <strong>inappropriate</strong> section below will lead to your paper being <em>instantly</em> rejected from any top-tier journal.</p>\\n<p>First, your problem MUST be an optimization problem. You need to define a &quot;fitness function&quot; that you are trying to optimize and you need to have a way to measure it.</p>\\n<h3>Good</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Crossover functions are easy to define and natural</strong>: When dealing with certain kinds of data, crossover/mutation functions might be easy to define. For example strings (eg. DNA or gene sequences) can be mutated easily by splicing two candidate strings to obtain a new one (this is why nature uses genetic algorithms!). Trees (like phylogenetic trees or parse trees) can be spliced too, by replacing a branch of one tree with a branch from another. Shapes (like airplane wings or boat shapes) can be mutated easily by drawing a grid on the shape and combining different grid sections from the parents to obtain a child. Usually this means your problem is composed of different parts and putting together parts from distinct solutions is a valid candidate solution.</li>\\n<li>This means that if your problem is defined in a vector space where the coordinates don\\'t have any special meaning, GAs are not a good choice. If it is hard to formulate your problem as a GA, it is not worth it.</li>\\n<li><strong>Black Box evaluation</strong>: If for a candidate, your fitness function is evaluated outside the computer, GAs are a good idea. For example, if you are testing a wing shape in an air tunnel, genetic algorithms will help you generate good candidate shapes to try.</li>\\n<li><strong>Exception: Simulations</strong>. If your fitness function is measuring how well a nozzle design performs and requires simulating the fluid dynamics for each nozzle shape, GAs may work well for you. They may also work if you are simulating a physical system through time and are interested in how well your design performs over the course of the operation eg. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRthdBr46cs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">modelling locomotion patterns</a>. However, methods that use partial differential equations as constraints are being developed in the literature, eg. <a href=\"https://www.siam.org/meetings/op08/Heinkenschloss.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PDE constrained optimization</a>, so this may change in the future.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Inappropriate</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>You can calculate a gradient</strong> for your function: If you have access to the gradient of your function, you can do gradient descent, which is in general much more efficient than GAs. Gradient descent may have issues with local minima (as will GAs) but many methods have been studied to mitigate this.</li>\\n<li><strong>You know the fitness function in closed form</strong>: Then, you can probably calculate the gradient. Many languages have libraries supporting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">automatic differentiation</a>, so you don\\'t even need to do it manually. If your function is not differentiable, then you can use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subgradient_method\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">subgradient descent</a>.</li>\\n<li>Your optimization problem is of a known form, like a <strong>linear program or a quadratic program</strong>: GAs (and black box optimization methods in general) are very inefficient in terms of the number of candidates they need to evaluate, and are best avoided if possible.</li>\\n<li><strong>Your solution space is small</strong>: If you can grid your search space efficiently, you can guarantee that you have found the best solution, and can make contour plots of the solution space to see if there is a region you need to explore further.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Finally, if you are considering a GA, consider more recent work in Evolutionary Strategies. I am biased towards <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CMA-ES</a>, which I think is a good simple algorithm that captures the notion of a gradient in the fitness landscape in a way that traditional GAs do not.</p>\\n'),\n",

To\\n  facilitate imagined speech, a Brain-to-Computer Interface (BCI) must\\n  be implemented to provide silent communication abilities directly\\n  between the two entities. One of the most popular methods for\\n  interfacing directly between a human brain and a computer is through\\n  electroencephalographic signals.</p>\\n  \\n  <p>Researchers have created models capable of achieving 70 - 90%\\n  predictive accuracy in recognizing patterns in EEG data;\\n  however, the accuracy of current methods for unspoken speech\\n  recognition is not yet sufficient to enable fluid communication\\n  between humans and machines.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>High Level Experiment Design</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>the subjects were asked to imagine a specific word or feeling (label).\\n  The subjects responded to a set of uniform verbal cues describing the\\n  set of labels as well as the desired individual label to imagine. The\\n  data was then processed in order to minimize the effects of irrelevant\\n  signal activity, or noise. Additionally the data was processed to\\n  minimize its volume while still maintaining the core “information” in\\n  the data. The condensed dataset was created by dropping irrelevant\\n  information from the EEG device and applying principal component\\n  analysis (PCA) to the video stream data. Once the data was processed\\n  and assembled into the correct format, cross-validation using a random\\n  forest algorithm was performed on the control group of EEG signals\\n  alone and on the hypothesis group consisting of both EEG and video\\n  data. The predictive accuracy measurements obtained from the\\n  cross-validation experiments were used as metrics to evaluate the\\n  success of the hypothesis.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>The results show a notable improvement classifying thoughts when in conjunction with the video streams.</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LH6sI.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LH6sI.png\" alt=\"graph of predictive accuracy\"></a></p>\\n'),\n",

In such a case, success at an \\'EQ test\\' is not really grounded in the real-world.</p>\\n\\n<p>In an essay entitled \"The ineradicable Eliza effect and its dangers\", Douglas Hofstadter gives the following example, in which the ACME program is claimed (not by Hofstadter) to \\'understand\\' analogy.</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Here the computer learns about a fellow named Sluggo taking his wife Jane and\\n  his good buddy Buck to a bar, where things take their natural course and Jane\\n  winds up pregnant by Buck. She has the baby but doesn\\'t want it, and so, aided\\n  by her husband, she drowns the baby in a river, thus \"neatly solving \"the problem\"\\n  of Bambi.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>This story is presented to ACME in the following form:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>ql: (neglectful-husband (Sluggo))\\nq2: (lonely-and-sex-starved-wife (Jane-Doe))\\nq3: (macho-ladykiller (Buck-Stag))\\nq4: (poor-innocent-little-fetus (Bambi))\\nq5: (takes-out-to-local-bar (Sluggo Jane-Doe Buck-Stag))\\n...\\nq11: (neatly-solves-the-problem-of (Jane-Doe Bambi))\\nq12: (cause (ql0 q11))\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>Suppose the program were to be asked if Jane Doe\\'s behavior was moral. Complex compound emotional concepts such as \\'neglectful\\', \\'lonely\\' and \\'innocent\\' are here simply predicates, not available to the AI for deeper introspective examination. They could just as easily be replaced by labels such as as \\'bling-blang-blong15657\\'. </p>\\n\\n<p>So in one sense, the absence of success at an EQ test with any depth is indicative of the general problem currently facing AI: the inability to define (or otherwise learn) meaningful representations of subtle complexities of the human world, which is a lot more complex than being able to recognize videos of cats.</p>\\n'),\n",

Predicting long-term weather is quite difficult, because it is a chaotic system where small changes can lead to very different results. Using Monte Carlo methods, you could run a large number of simulations, each with slightly different atmospheric changes. Then you can analyze the results and for example calculate the probability of rain on a given day based on how many simulations ended up with rain. </p>\\n\\n<p>As for the use of Monte Carlo in Alpha Go, they seem to be using the so-called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search\">Monte Carlo Tree Search</a>. In this approach, you make a tree of possible moves, a few turns into the future, and try to find the best sequence. However, since the number of possible moves in the game of go is very large, you won\\'t be able to explore very far ahead. This means that some of the moves which look good now might turn out to be bad later. </p>\\n\\n<p>So, in the Monte Carlo Tree Search, you pick a promising sequence of moves and run one or more simulations of how the game might proceed from that point. Then you can use the results of that simulation to get a better idea of how good that specific sequence of moves really is and you update the tree accordingly. Repeat as needed until you find a good move.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you want more information or to look at some illustrations, I found an interesting paper on the topic: C.

(All pieces receive the raw sensory inputs, and output actions, some of which turn off or on other systems.)</p>\\n\\n<p>But a better approach is the normal hierarchical control approach, in which the target of a lower level system is the output of a higher level system. That is, the targeted joint angle of a robot leg is determined by the system that is trying to optimize the velocity, which is determined by a system that is trying to optimize the trajectory, which is determined by a system that is trying to optimize the target position, and so on.</p>\\n\\n<p>This allows for increasing level of complexity while maintaining detail and system reusability.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>That said, I don\\'t think you actually need what one would naively call \\'embodied cognition\\' in order to get the bottom-up hierarchy of competencies that Brooks is right to point towards.

This is very different to how humans learn by creating concepts, relationship, common sense reasoning which gives the ability to learn much without too much data. Therefore machine learning with common-sense reasoning capabilities should be researched further more.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong>Decision techniques.</strong></p>\\n<p>Current AI-based systems have very limited ability for making decisions, therefore new techniques must be developed (e.g. modeling systemic risks, analyzing tradeoffs, detecting anomalies in context, analyzing data while preserving privacy).</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong>Domain-specific AI systems.</strong></p>\\n<p>The current AI-based system is lack of abilities to understand the variety of domains of human expertise (such as medicine, engineering, law and many more). The systems should be able to perform professional-level tasks such as designing problems, experiments, managing contradictions, negotiating, etc.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong>Data assurance and trust.</strong></p>\\n<p>The current AI-based systems require huge amounts of data and their behaviour directly depends on the quality of this data which can be biased, incomplete or compromised. This can be expensive and time-consuming especially where it is used for safety-critical systems which potentially can be very dangerous.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong>Radically efficient computing infrastructure.</strong></p>\\n<p>The current AI-based systems require unprecedented workloads and computing power which require the development of new computing architectures (such as neuromorphic).</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong>Interpretability and explanations.</strong></p>\\n<p>For people to follow AI suggestions, they need to trust systems, and this is only when they are capable of knowing users\\' intents, priorities, reasoning and they can learn from their mistakes. These capabilities are required in many business domains and professionals</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong>Value alignment and ethics.</strong></p>\\n<p>Humans can share the common knowledge of how the world function, the machine cannot. They can fail by having unintended and unexpected behaviour only because humans did not specify the right goals for them or they omitted essential training details. The systems should be able to correct the specification of the goals and avoid unintended and undesired consequences in the behaviour.</p>\\n</li>\\n<li><p><strong>Social AI.</strong></p>\\n<p>The AI-based systems should be able to work closely with humans in their professional and personal life, therefore they should have significant social capabilities because they can impact our emotions and our decision-making capabilities. Also, sophisticated natural language capabilities will need to be developed to allow a natural interaction and dialogue between humans and machines.</p>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Source: <em>Fundamental questions in AI research, and the most important research gaps (RFI questions 5 and 6)</em>.

              "               '<p>There has been quite a few approaches to achieve such kind of distributed coordination. I present here one of them, for its generality and simplicity (that makes it easy to remember too). But first, the general idea behind these approaches is pretty interesting, around a mechanism called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy\">stigmergy</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Stigmergy is a behaviour coordination mechanism mediated by the environment. It was first described for termites, and the most famous example pertains to ants. Ants form trails when going out for food, but they often do not interact <em>directly</em>. It turns out they leave pheromones on the ground as they walk away from their hills. The pheromone allows them to find their way home, and it also guides where they are going: If they find a pheromone trace from one of their peers, they follow it and their own pheromones <em>add up</em>, reinforcing the signal of the trail. In stage, more and more ants get \"together as they move\", forming a trail. Coordination has been achieved.</p>\\n\\n<p>Among the various implementation derived from stigmergy, there is the \"field-based motion coordination model\" (FBMCM). The idea is to create a (maybe virtual) environment that maintains some states of the world. Each object registers in the environment a signal that is maximum at the object position (its edges) and then decreases with distance. Moving objects (e.g. robots) each emit a signal relayed by the environment. They can then sense each other\\'s field and act accordingly: E.g., when signals are strong, move away; when weak, it is safe to get closer, etc. Several complex group moves have been demonstrated in software simulators (platoon formation in games, drill simulations) and with robots. The benefit of this approach is that it can be cheap to compute even complex behaviours. For example, avoiding clashes requires simple \"logic\" code based on summing-up nearby fields value. FBMCM is pretty slick, used in video-games, but hard to implement in physical settings (to my <em>dating</em> knowledge), as it can be challenging to build a reliable environment. See for example the work from <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2949751_Field-based_Motion_Coordination_In_Quake_3_Arena\">Mamei and Zambonelli</a>, as well as one of the first industrial implementations for robots by <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221456459_Decentralized_control_of_E%27GV_transportation_systems\">Weyns et al.</a>. Note that the implementation for robots required significant work on the environment infrastructure, made somewhat more feasible as it was a controlled warehouse.</p>\\n\\n<p>The advantage of stigmergy-like models is that they are often <em>simple</em> and <em>resilient</em>: You can lose an ant without impact on the food-finding trail. On the downside, these models are usually <em>slow</em>, as the coordination takes time to emerge from indirect interactions. This can be improved upon by adding extra direct interactions (e.g. empowering ants with a GPS and a grocery store map, or just a magnetic-North sense).</p>\\n\\n<p>In practice, these models can collapse if the environment implementation is not reliable. It can be difficult for robots or, say, self-driving cars, if they expect some transponders put on their way, as these devices are expensive to set and maintain, and they can be broken or stolen. It would be better to endow robots with radars, sonars or other proximity sensors to implement stigmergic models. One related example is the decision by Tesla to add radars to its cars, instead of assuming reliable transponders on the road (<em>note</em>: This is just a parallel; there is no official relation).</p>\\n\\n<p>Other implementations and related models are, for example, tuple-based coordination languages such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_(coordination_language)\">Linda</a>, and network protocols like <a href=\"https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/chord:sigcomm01/chord_sigcomm.pdf\">Chord</a>. As you see, these works are not necessarily in the \"AI domain\".</p>\\n'),\n",

Mark believed that the original Lovelace Test would be impossible to pass, and therefore, suggested a weaker, and more practical version.</p>\\n\\n<p>The Lovelace Test 2.0 makes the assumption that for an AI to be intelligent, it must exhibit creativity. From the paper itself:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>The Lovelace 2.0 Test is as follows: artificial agent <span class=\"math-container\">$a $</span> is challenged as follows:</p>\\n  \\n  <ul>\\n  <li><p><span class=\"math-container\">$a$</span> must create an artifact <span class=\"math-container\">$o$</span> of type <span class=\"math-container\">$t$</span>;</p></li>\\n  <li><p><span class=\"math-container\">$o$</span> must conform to a set of constraints <span class=\"math-container\">$C$</span> where <span class=\"math-container\">$c_i ∈ C$</span> is\\n  any criterion expressible in natural language;</p></li>\\n  <li><p>a human evaluator <span class=\"math-container\">$h$</span>, having chosen <span class=\"math-container\">$t$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$C$</span>, is satisfied\\n  that <span class=\"math-container\">$o$</span> is a valid instance of <span class=\"math-container\">$t$</span> and meets <span class=\"math-container\">$C$</span>; and</p></li>\\n  <li><p>a human referee <span class=\"math-container\">$r$</span> determines the combination of <span class=\"math-container\">$t$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$C$</span>\\n  to not be unrealistic for an average human.</p></li>\\n  </ul>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Since it is possible for a human evaluator to come up with some pretty easy constraints for an AI to beat, the human evaluator is then expected to keep coming up with more and more complex constraints for the AI until the AI fails. The point of the Lovelace Test 2.0 is to <em>compare</em> the creativity of different AIs, not to provide a definite dividing line between \\'intelligence\\' and \\'nonintelligence\\' like the Turing Test would.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, I am curious about whether this test has actually been used in an academic setting, or it is only seen as a thought experiment at the moment. The Lovelace Test seems easy to apply in academic settings (you only need to develop some measurable constraints that you can use to test the artificial agent), but it also may be too subjective (humans can disagree on the merits of certain constraints, and whether a creative artifact produced by an AI actually meets the final result).</p>\\n'),\n",

In the 80s and 90s, NNs were weighted graphs that could be executed on computers using graph libraries or similar foundation libs. Choosing the weights was challenging. One day the back-propagation learning model was introduced to automated the choice of weights. The model relied on a procedure dedicated to NNs, using a terminology like partial derivates, gradient descent, chain rules, etc. And later then, clever engineers created libraries to automate the back-propagation procedure. The libraries can be somewhat far from the original model, as engineers learn how to make it computable, even faster (i.e. optimization, approximations/truncations).</p>\\n'),\n",

Short version: yes, we know what went wrong, but probably not how to fix it yet.</p>\\n\\n<p>Basically, AlphaGo is good at making lots of small decisions well, and managing risk and uncertainty better than humans can. One of the things that\\'s surprising about it relative to previous bots that play Go is how good it was at tactical fights; in previous games, Lee had built a position that AlphaGo needed to attack, and then AlphaGo successfully attacked it.</p>\\n\\n<p>So in this game, Lee played the reverse strategy. Instead of trying to win many different influence battles, where AlphaGo had already shown it was stronger than him, he would set up one critical battle (incurring minor losses along the way), and then defeat it there, with ripple events that would settle the match in his favor.</p>\\n\\n<p>So what\\'s the weakness of AlphaGo that allowed that to work? As I understand it, this is a fundamental limitation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). MCTS works by randomly sampling game trees and averaging them; if 70% of games from a particular position go well and 30% of games from another position go well, then you should probably play the first move instead of the second move.</p>\\n\\n<p>But when there\\'s a specific sequence of plays that go well--if, say, W has a path that requires them playing exactly the right stone each time, but B has no possible response to this path--then MCTS breaks down, because you can only find that narrow path through minimax reasoning, and moving from the slower minimax reasoning to the faster MCTS is one of the big reasons why bots are better now than they were in the past.</p>\\n\\n<p>It\\'s unclear how to get around this. There may be a way to notice this sort of threat, and then temporarily switch from MCTS reasoning to minimax reasoning, or to keep around particular trajectories in memory for consideration in future plays. </p>\\n'),\n",

Each such agent implements a function that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to represent these functions, such as reactive agents, real-time planners, and decision-theoretic systems. We explain the role of <strong>learning</strong> as extending the reach of the designer into <strong>unknown environments</strong>, and we show how that role constrains agent design, favoring explicit <strong>knowledge representation and reasoning</strong>.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/9332543518\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach - Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig</a></p>\\n\\n<p>So the example you cite, \"autopilot for cars/planes\", is actually a (famous) form of AI as it has to <strong>use a form of knowledge representation to deal with unknown environments and circumstances</strong>. Ultimately, these systems also collect data so that the knowledge representation can be updated to deal with the new inputs that they have found.

There are many different types of well defined knowledge representation methods, ranging from the popular <a href=\"http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">neural net</a>, through to probabilistic models like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">bayesian networks (belief networks)</a> - but fundamentally actions by the system must be derived from whichever representation of knowledge you choose for it to be considered as AI.</p>\\n'),\n",

Assuming the assistive system relies on ML technologies to learn about obstacles from a video stream (such systems do exist):</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>It may be that the learning data was not \"good enough\" to cover the truck scenario.</li>\\n<li>It may be the technology was not powerful enough yet (lack generalization power, or simply too slow).</li>\\n<li>It may be a hardware problem, notably from the sensors: If the \"car\\'s eyes\" are defective, the \"car\\'s brain\" (the assistive system) is unable to react properly.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Why those technologies did not work in that case will remain a secret. We can say however that <em>any system</em>---whether built with AI technology or not---has limits. Beyond these limits, the system reaction is unpredictable: It could stop, reset, shutdown. The difficulty here is to define what a \"default behaviour\" is. A machine will basically do whatever it is designed to do, so an AI-based system too.</p>\\n\\n<p>We could speculate even more on what would happen if the assistive system was really autonomous, the elusive AGI, but that is really not the case here.</p>\\n'),\n",

Many AI experts, cognizant of the difficulty of getting simple systems to work effectively today, think that AI able to take control is not urgent, and as detail-minded engineers, they think it will be profoundly difficult to do any useful work today. (Andrew Ng, for example, famously called these sorts of worries like worrying about overpopulation on Mars.) Given radical uncertainty among AI experts as to when this will become an issue, however, this means we can\\'t rule out rapid AI timescales, and should do at least some work in anticipation of those timescales.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Whether or not the problem is hard. Many people give short, simple, and wrong solutions to the control problem. Probably the most famous is the idea that intelligence and morality are inherently interlinked, and thus a more intelligent machine, <em>by definition</em>, will be more moral. The Orthogonality Thesis is the claim of the opposite, that intelligence and morality (or, more specifically, goal alignment) are unrelated things.</p></li>\\n<li><p>What foundations we can lay now. There are a bunch of open problems (see, for example, <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/technical-agenda/\">MIRI\\'s technical agenda</a>) that deal with mathematical logic of the sort that would be useful for ensuring robust value alignment, or on how to effectively do value learning (without giving an incentive to distort values), or on how to build value functions and goals such that they are fixable if they turn out to be mistaken.

Examples might not be 100% accurate.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the simplest form, network is trained using the apriori information extracted from the ground truth. This basically means that ANN uses the relation between the input and output. </p>\\n\\n<p>For instance, if you are to classify shrubs and trees, one of the input could be height and the other could be the width of the tree. Now, if you have only input and output layers, increasing height means increasing chance for the object to be a tree. Thus, input height would have a positive weight connecting to tree output and a negative weight to shrub output. However, as the plant gets wider, the chance of it being a shrub increases. Taller shrubs are wider than shorter ones. Thus input weight would have positive weight connecting to the shrub output. Finally, the chance of being a tree is not affected by the width and thus will have close to 0 weight between this input and output. This network will effectively work like a linear discriminant classifier.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now instead of assigning weights by hand, you may use a learning algorithm that tries to adjust weights so that the output is correct when the series of input is supplied. Ideally this training algorithm should reach to the conclusion that we have made in the previous example. Most training algorithms are recursive. They supply the inputs multiple times, and in a simple sense, they reward pathways that are correct by increasing their weights and punishes pathways that are causing incorrect answer.</p>\\n\\n<p>When hidden layers are used in a system, they would be able to correlate input on higher degrees. Thus, as the number of layers get higher, ANN learns the input set much better. However, this does not mean it gets better. If the ANN over fits the input set, it would be affected from the random noise that is in the dataset. This problem is generally referred as memorization. There are learning algorithms that try to minimize memorization and maximize generalization ability. But ultimately, the number of training samples should be high enough so that ANN cannot overfit to the data.</p>\\n'),\n",

For example, genes A and B might contribute to fitness only when they’re both set to 1: if either is set to 0, then the fact that the other is set to 1 doesn’t do anything.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Also note that <em>crossover is not a global operator</em>. If the only operator is crossover then (also from p42):</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Eventually the population will converge, and often (unfortunately) prematurely\\n  converge, to copies of the same individual. At this stage there’s no escape: when an individual crosses over with itself, nothing new is generated.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>For this reason, crossover is generally used together with some global mutation operator.</p>\\n'),\n",

You could in principle use the entire tree but to my knowledge <a href=\"http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume11/vishwanathan10a/vishwanathan10a.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ML on graph and tree structures</a> is still in relative infancy.</p>\\n'),\n",

As mentioned again, the system wasn\\'t intended for hands-free driving and parts of the system was unfinished. Not to mention that the car was driving with full speed under the trailer.</p>\\n<p>Tesla officially said about this crash in a statement on its website:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p><strong>The high ride height of the trailer combined with its positioning across the road and the extremely rare circumstances</strong> of the impact caused the Model S to pass under the trailer, with the bottom of the trailer impacting the windshield of the Model S.</p>\\n<p>Neither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor-trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>They also said, according to techno-optimists, that they will tweaks their code, so this particular case won\\'t happen again.</p>\\n<p>To summarize, this was a \\'technical failure\\' of braking system and most likely Autopilot was not at as Tesla told Senate.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/obdLM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/obdLM.png\" alt=\"The New York Times |Source: Florida traffic crash report\" /></a></p>\\n<p><sup>The New York Times |Source: Florida traffic crash report</sup></p>\\n<p>Sources:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2016/07/01/tesla-autopilot-death-highlights-autonomous-risks/86591130/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tesla Autopilot death highlights autonomous risks</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://robotfuturesbook.wordpress.com/2016/07/01/layers-of-autonomy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Layers of Autonomy</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/07/01/business/inside-tesla-accident.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Inside the Self-Driving Tesla Fatal Accident</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jun/30/tesla-autopilot-death-self-driving-car-elon-musk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tesla driver dies in first fatal crash while using autopilot mode</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n'),\n",

To me, it feels a bit like <em>playing god</em>: Artificial (given) Intelligence would hence imply Artificial (given) Personality. This approach to the problem seems to be supported by the next fragment:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>a notion of personality is useful</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>I point to the above because I don\\'t think that artificial intelligence... <strong><em>Intelligence</em></strong> itself, actually, need to be given or assigned, or even have a <em>use</em> in the sense of a <em>purpose</em>. </p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p><strong>The previous note</strong> was about <em>emergence</em>, which is a topic that <a href=\"https://ai.stackexchange.com/users/42/user217281728\">user217281728</a> briefly addressed in <a href=\"https://ai.stackexchange.com/a/1596/70\">their answer</a>. In this second approach, the particular traits <em>just happen</em>, or <em>develop</em>. The interaction between the (so-called) agents and their environment, as well as fellow agents can give place to new behaviour patterns, not designed beforehand. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>In an evolutionary</strong> approach, if the personality would happen to have an advantage (or at least not represent a disadvantage), then it could just appear. Of course, I am making a number of assumptions and demarcations here as well:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>I am thinking about embodied intelligence</li>\\n<li>I speak of evolutionary robotics</li>\\n<li>I think on social issues being of importance</li>\\n<li>I assume that <em>personality</em> could emerge</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p><strong>Now, an example</strong> that I find extremely interesting is that of the little mobile robots which could move around and end-up in a pool of <em>food</em> or a pool of <em>poison</em>. And they, somehow, by some odd chance, recognised or made a relation between signals sent by other robots, and the presence of food. Or not. That was more or less the thing: Some robots (kind of) learned to <em>conceal</em> information and thus had more time to eat themselves. Well, I would have a couple of personality adjectives for such guys.</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/106/37/15786.full\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here you find the article</a> and <a href=\"https://wp.unil.ch/mitrilab/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here you find some videos</a> and related stuff.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>And with that</strong>, we land at my last point: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism#In_computing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">We humans</a> put the adjectives, according to our social conditioning.

Interactivity.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Web pages aren\\'t just static, they change according HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Not only would you have to design your system to account for the rendering step, you would also make it have to understand the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness\">Turing Complete</a> scripting language <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript\">JavaScript</a>, as well as the less complicated, but inherently intertwined with HTML, CSS stylesheet language. If you thought the rendering process was easy, try training a neural network to handle complicated scripting patterns.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>4. New Standards</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>Not all HTML is equal, because of different standards. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Hypertext_Application_Technology_Working_Group\">WHATWG</a> began working on HTML5 in 2004, and browsers started to implement not long after. In 2004, there were very few examples of HTML5 sites to train your network to begin with. Sure, now it\\'s standardized and every website uses it, but what about HTML6? When the first specification is released (probably 2017-2025), virtually no websites will use it, because no one will support it. Only when it finally becomes standard, probably in the late 2020s or early 2030s, will you have enough data to train your monstrous system of neural networks</p>\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n<p>As for AI in general, one could argue that browsers already use A.I. in their rendering process. They intelligently decide what to render (taking CSS into account), when in order to get the most efficient render time, they selectively use different JavaScript parsers on different sections of the code to optimize the speed, the whole system has been optimized on another ruleset to make rendering and interacting with a webpage as seamless and easy-to-use as possible. Your system will never be as good as what hundreds of humans have optimized over 20 years.</p>\\n\\n<p>Trying to solve HTML rendering with Neural Networks is akin to trying to nail a nail with a screwdriver. It\\'s just not going to work</p>\\n\\n<p>Hope this was helpful!</p>\\n'),\n",

Further, people often don't act emotionally how they would expect themselves to act, for example we have all experienced frustration at someone else's irrational concerns and yet we are all guilty of holding irrational concerns of our own. This is the crux of why hard-coded emotional rules do not work - we do not have an understanding of what emotional 'rules' make someone feel real.</p>\\n\\n<p>By moving towards autonomous state-based actors we move away from this issue. The actor's state transitions will of course be defined rules (hard-coded or learnt) but by abstracting the actor's emotional state from the specific context (e.g. specific actions trigger emotional state transitions which trigger responses, instead of a direct response to a specific action), the programmer prevents them-self from projecting their own beliefs/emotions/logic onto the actor. </p>\\n\\n<p>Further, autonomous actors are more extendable. Consider an autonomous actor that is hard-coded to move towards 'upset' and 'angry' emotional states when experiencing 'pain'. Simply by associating a new world action with 'pain', one can trigger an emotional response from an autonomous actor that has not experienced that action before.

Stop when you get to one containing a flavor of intelligence that passes whatever test you have in mind. Steven Wolfram has suggested something <a href=\"https://www.inverse.com/article/12838-stephen-wolfram-could-there-be-alien-intelligence-among-the-digits-of-pi\" rel=\"nofollow\">broadly along these lines</a>. Problem: the state of computational testing for intelligence <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winograd_Schema_Challenge\" rel=\"nofollow\">e.g. Winograd schema</a> would then be the bottleneck. In the limit, testing for intelligence requires intelligence and creativity on behalf of the questioner.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\'No\\': It may be that, even with infinite ability to simulate, there may be some missing aspect of our simulation that is necessary for intelligence. For example, AFAIK quantum gravity (for which we lack an adequate theory) is involved in Penrose\\'s <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140116085105.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Quantum Microtubules\"</a> theory of consciousness (*). What if that was needed, but we didn\\'t know how to include it in the simulation?</p>\\n\\n<p>The reason for talking in terms of such incredibly costly computations as \\'simulate all possible universes\\' (or at least a brain-sized portion of them) is to deliberately generalize away from the specifics of any techniques currently in vogue (DL, neuromorphic systems etc). The point is that we could be missing something essential for intelligence from <em>any</em> of these models and (as far as we know from our current theories of physical reality) only empirical evidence to the contrary would tell us otherwise.</p>\\n\\n<p>(*) No-one knows if consciousness is required for Strong AI, and physics can\\'t distinguish a conscious entity from a <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zombie</a>.</p>\\n'),\n",

Turing displayed one-of-a-kind genius when it came to things like computing and cryptography, but like many other experts in such fields, he had a lot of trouble grappling with metaphysics and philosophy. Searle had more common sense, but his Chinese Room example is more of a rebuttal to the Turing Test than a test in and of itself.</p>\\n\\n<p>What \"intelligence\" consists of is ultimately a deep metaphysical question, not a material one. For millennia, trained philosophers have had a lot of trouble assigning clear definitions to concepts like intelligence and consciousness. Until we can answer those questions definitively, using different sets of reasoning skills than scientists, mathematicians and computer specialists are used to employing (just look at how often metaphysics is derided in some of these disciplines) then we cannot say that we have achieved genuine A.I. Until we can define what intelligence is, we cannot say whether or not we\\'ve successfully built it; we\\'ve not only got the cart before the horse, but have yet to build the cart or see a horse. By the common definitions used in everyday speech we\\'re nowhere near genuine A.I. No one calls cows or sparrows \"intelligent,\" but our AI today isn\\'t even as sophisticated as the mosquitoes that bite them. </p>\\n\\n<p>That\\'s not going to be a popular answer - I\\'ll probably get a dozen downvotes for this, without anyone being able to adequately rebut my contentions, but it needs to be said. There\\'s far too much irrational exuberance and gross overestimation of what we\\'ve achieved to date and probably always will be in this field. Historically, researchers in every generation have also grossly underestimated the computing power of the human brain; every decade or so, the estimates of the FLOPS and megabytes have to be drastically revised. We have a poor track record of even getting basic material questions about the human brain right. This clear, consistent pattern of biased overestimation of our success and the lack of any real definition, let alone a test, of intelligence is going to be a serious issue in this forum for its whole existence (assuming it survives the private beta period). We have a whole forum dedicated to a field we can\\'t even define; we can\\'t say for sure what A.I. really is, but we\\'re adamantly certain that we\\'re close to achieving it...!  We cannot say if \"brute force algorithms\" exist when we\\'re still groping for an understanding of what it is we\\'re trying to force our way into. Certainly, there are brute force methods to solve certain problems, like Deep Blue does at chess - but we cannot say if that qualifies as intelligence or not. It is really not possible to answer questions like this without getting into deep discussions that immediately lend themselves to opinion and debate, which the Turing Test and Searle\\'s Room are clear examples of, in and of themselves. Since implementation details of AI are considered by many to be off-limits here, we\\'re limited mainly to highly speculative posts about tech that often doesn\\'t even work yet (like Google\\'s self-driving cars) and questions like this that we can\\'t answer without first defining intelligence. This is going to be the root of a lot of problems here for a long, long time to come...</p>\\n'),\n",

We now have Chef Watson, Watson Health, and many other developing projects along the \"cognitive\" route. <em>Watson</em> is really an amalgamation and varied application of the different cognitive computing routes IBM is pursuing.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, there are many forms of NLP that Watson conducts and has conducted, developed by different teams to fit different processes, interconnected in different ways. Additionally, much (probably all) of it is proprietary/classified since, as one would imagine, ongoing research is constantly being conducted and added to Watson. This is likely your largest obstacle. The precise workings of the NLP of the Jeopardy flavor of Watson are probably themselves still classified (I can\\'t find anything in the time I\\'ve just spent looking myself)</p>\\n\\n<p>There are, thus, many answers to this question; many outdated, and others not always applicable. The full answer is very complicated and, by the time you find out what the answer is today, it\\'s probably already been advanced. The researches I know are always working on new, cutting-edge algorithms and processes for text classification and the related NLP topics.

To understand what\\'s going on under the hood of a neural network you only really need to understand an individual neuron. </p>\\n\\n<p>Now each neuron has a set of inputs (other neurons; they can potentially be the inputs to the network as a whole as well), and each input has a weight associated with it. Every time the network is used, each neuron computes its output as the weighted sum of its inputs passed through some gate (The \"Activation Function\", a mathematical function designed to get a particular behaviour. For example sigmoid AF takes an input of any size and transforms it into an output in the range [0, 1].) Obviously, this is driven from the inputs to the neural network so that no neuron is computing its outputs before all of the neurons used as its inputs have done the same.</p>\\n\\n<p>When you refer to the value of a node; there isn\\'t a single value. Each neuron has several weights associated with it as it may be the input to several other neurons, and each of those neurons assigns it a different weight. Instead, it is better to thing of a neural network as a directed graph of nodes (neurons) which are labelled with a particular activation function, and edges (input/output connections) which are labelled with a particular weight. While the structure and activation functions used in the neural networks is a matter of topology design, there are a number of algorithms for designing a ANN for a particular topology.</p>\\n\\n<p>The most commonly used (and possibly easiest to explain) is backpropagation. In pseudo-Layman\\'s terms we start off with random weights on all edges in the network. We then compute the output of the network for a training set (a set of known input/output pairs). By careful choice of activation function, it is possible to differentiate the error (computed analogously to the expected output minus the actual output of the ANN for each input/output pair) with respect to the weights of the neural network. This allows us to compute a gradient for each weight; the direction in which we can move the weight to reduce the error on the training set. By doing this until we find an optima (a point where all movements increase error), we can find some \\'good\\' configuration of weights for that particular ANN. </p>\\n\\n<p>There\\'s a nice tutorial on BP here <a href=\"http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417ml/MLP2/BackPropagation.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417ml/MLP2/BackPropagation.html</a>.

This identities discrete named \"things\" - people, places, companies, etc.  Another engine does entity matching with a pre-established database of entities - specifically (in the out-of-the-box configuration) a dump of entities from <a href=\"http://www.dbpedia.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">DBPedia</a>.  Where a match is found, the text from the original input is assigned to the entity.  In the case of a collision, it assigns a weight to the mapping so any downstream consumers can use probabilistic techniques to select the \"correct\" mapping.</p>\\n\\n<p>There are, of course, more details that I left out.  Before NER can happen there is parsing and tokenizing and other NLP activities.  But a big part of the basic process is doing NER and then doing the entity matching.  </p>\\n\\n<p>And in the case of Stanbol, you can add your own entities and corresponding structured data, as well as your own engines.  So, for example, if you wanted to write an engine based on neural networks / deep learning, and plug that in, you could.</p>\\n'),\n",

Image identification is a good example of that. \"Traditional <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_logic_programming\">ILP</a>/relational learning approaches\" use several kinds of information to produce hypotheses about the data set, but apparently allow for no noise in the data.</p>\\n\\n<p>Statistical relational learning models are intended to work with data sets that have several types of objects connected to each other via various links (hence \"relational\"). They also are meant to deal with uncertainty (hence \"statistical\").</p>\\n\\n<p>Skipping past some slides that aren\\'t really useful without a transcript of what was said over them, we come to slide 17, which has comprehensible definitions and examples:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <ul>\\n  <li><strong>Object classification</strong>\\n  \\n  <ul>\\n  <li>Predicting the category of an object based on its attributes <em>and</em> its links <em>and</em> attributes of linked objects</li>\\n  <li>e.g., predicting the topic of a paper based on the words used in the paper the topics of papers it cites the used in the paper, the topics of papers it cites, the research interests of the author</li>\\n  </ul></li>\\n  <li><strong>Object type prediction</strong>\\n  \\n  <ul>\\n  <li>Predicting the type of an object based on its attributes and its links and attributes of linked objects</li>\\n  <li>e.g., predict the venue type of a publication (conference, journal, workshop) based on properties of the paper</li>\\n  </ul></li>\\n  </ul>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>As you can see, these models can keep track of several things and the interactions between them. The next slide talks about link prediction, the ability to predict several attributes of connections between objects, like the importance/quality of a citation. As previously mentioned, these models don\\'t require 100% accurate data to give interesting results; academic citation lists might occasionally be less than comprehensive, and the importance of a citation is challenging to quantify.</p>\\n\\n<p>Like ILP, SLP will hopefully be able to \"see\" new kinds of links between \"entities\", as with the presentation\\'s example of identifying research communities.</p>\\n\\n<p>Past slide 20, the presentation goes into some serious mathematics. It does have a much less technical conclusion starting at slide 198. </p>\\n'),\n",

If that objective is clear, it will provide clarity to whether or not having emotional quotient in AI make sense.

Again, note that \"displaying\" emotions and \"feeling\" emotions are two completely different things. </p>\\n\\n<p>You can program a thing like paro to modulate the voice tones or facial twitches to express sympathy, affection, companionship, or whatever - but while doing so, a paro does NOT empathize with its owner - it is simply faking it by performing the physical manifestations of an emotion. It never \"feels\" anything remotely closer to what that emotion evokes in human brain. </p>\\n\\n<p>So this distinction is really important.

Secretaries and nontechnical administrative staff thought the machine was a \"real\" therapist, and spent hours revealing their personal problems to the program. When Weizenbaum informed his secretary that he, of course, had access to the logs of all the conversations, she reacted with outrage at this invasion of her privacy. Weizenbaum was shocked by this and similar incidents to find that such a simple program could so easily deceive a naive user into revealing personal information.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Wikipedia\\'s article on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\"ELIZA Effect\"</a>:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Though designed strictly as a mechanism to support \"natural language conversation\" with a computer, ELIZA\\'s DOCTOR script was found to be surprisingly successful in eliciting emotional responses from users who, in the course of interacting with the program, began to ascribe understanding and motivation to the program\\'s output. As Weizenbaum later wrote, <strong>\"I had not realized ... that extremely short exposures to a relatively simple computer program could induce powerful delusional thinking in quite normal people.\"</strong> Indeed, ELIZA\\'s code had not been designed to evoke this reaction in the first place. Upon observation, researchers discovered users unconsciously assuming ELIZA\\'s questions implied interest and emotional involvement in the topics discussed, <em>even when they consciously knew that ELIZA did not simulate emotion.</em></p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>ELIZA, despite its simplicity, was incredibly successful at its task of tricking other human beings. Even those who knew ELIZA was a bot would still talk to it. Obviously, ELIZA served as an inspiration for various other, more intelligent chatbots, such as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/science/for-sympathetic-ear-more-chinese-turn-to-smartphone-program.html?_r=0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Xiaoice</a>.

For example, subtract \\'Paris\\' from \\'France\\' and add \\'Italy\\' and you get \\'Rome\\'.</p>\\n\\n<p>What you need is something like a Sentiment2Vec (S2V) that captures the similarities between emotional transitions. Something like: subtract \\'fear\\' from \\'sadness\\', add \\'joy\\' and you get \\'hope\\'. Or: subtract \\'sting\\' from \\'papercut\\', add \\'smashed\\' and you get \\'throbbing\\'.</p>\\n\\n<p>The catch is that you don\\'t have an easily accessible corpus of emotional contexts to train with, like you have with words. If you had a million hours of fMRI - mapping the transitions between emotions in hundreds of subjects - then you could use that data to build an S2V. You probably don\\'t have that data though.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the mean time, you could just build a W2V that specializes in sentiment. You could even try to use a current sentiment analysis engine to bootstrap it. Perhaps if you read enough text that says \"I got a papercut and it stings\" and \"I smashed my finger and it\\'s throbbing\" then you could eventually produce an S2V. Children\\'s books often use explicit language regarding emotional context (\"this made the boy feel sad\").</p>\\n\\n<p>But words are still a far cry from the experiential context that a connectome map would provide. To test whether you have something useful or not, you might want to implement your S2V in a mouse foraging simulation - see whether it produces typical behavior and if any cooperative or competitive dynamics can organically grow out of your S2V.</p>\\n\\n<p>Some further info on the subject: </p>\\n\\n<p>In 2014, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-26019586\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glasgow University claimed</a><sup>2</sup> that there are four primary emotions: happiness, sadness, fear and anger. </p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"http://changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/basic%20emotions.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">This website</a><sup>3</sup> provides nice (if somewhat short) hierarchical breakdown of secondary and tertiary emotions under primary emotions.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\\n\\n<p><sub><sup>1</sup>: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec</a></sub></p>\\n\\n<p><sub><sup>2</sup>: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-26019586\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-26019586</a></sub></p>\\n\\n<p><sub><sup>3</sup>: <a href=\"http://changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/basic%20emotions.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">changingminds.org/explanations/emotions/basic%20emotions.htm</a></sub></p>\\n'),\n",

This optimization problem is very difficult to solve consider that the parameter space of the model (i.e. weights of the neural network) leads to a problem in extremely high dimension.

If they did, they\\'d have basically solved AGI.  But we can certainly talk about techniques that get part-of-the-way there, and approaches that could work.</p>\\n\\n<p>One thing I would consider trying (and I don\\'t know off-hand if anybody has tried this exact approach) is to model the disambiguation of each word as a discrete problem for a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bayesian Belief Network</a> where your priors (for any given word) are based on both stored \"knowledge\" as well as the previously encountered words in the (sentence|paragraph|document|whatever).  So if you \"know\", for example, that \"Reading is a city in the UK\" and that \"place names are usually capitalized\", your network should be strongly biased towards interpreting \"Reading\" as the city, since nothing in the word position in the sentence strongly contradicts that.  </p>\\n\\n<p>Of course I\\'m hand-waving around some tricky problems in saying that, as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning\" rel=\"nofollow\">knowledge representation</a> isn\\'t exactly a solved problem either.  But there are at least approaches out there that you could use.

Finding a good way to merge that stuff with a Bayesian framework could yield some interesting results.    </p>\\n\\n<p>There has been a bit of research on \"probabilistic RDF\" that you could possibly use as a starting point.

              "               '<p><strong>TL:DR</strong>: Hyper-heuristics <em>are</em> metaheuristics, suited for solving the same kind of optimization problems, but (in principle) affording a \"rapid prototyping\" approach for non-expert practitioners. In practice, there are issues with the prevailing approach, motivating an emerging perspective on <a href=\"http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszeo/docs/publications/HHrecharacterization.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\\'whitebox\\' hyper-heuristics</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>In more detail:</p>\\n\\n<p>Metaheuristics are methods for searching an intractably large space of possible solutions in order to find a \\'high quality\\' solution. Popular metaheuristics include Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search, Genetic Algorithms etc.</p>\\n\\n<p>The essential difference between metaheuristics and hyper-heuristics is the addition of a level of search indirection: informally, hyper-heuristics can be described as \\'heuristics for searching the space of heuristics\\'. One can therefore use any metaheuristic as a hyper-heuristic, providing the nature of the \\'space of heuristics\\' to be searched is appropriately defined.</p>\\n\\n<p>The application area for hyper-heuristics is therefore the same as metaheuristics. Their applicability (relative to metaheuristics) is as a \\'rapid prototyping tool\\': the original motivation was to allow non-expert practitioners to apply metaheuristics to their specific optimization problem (e.g. \"Travelling-Salesman (TSP) plus time-windows plus bin-packing\") without requiring expertise in the highly-specific problem domain. The idea was that this could be done by:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>Allowing practitioners to implement only very simple (effectively,\\nrandomized) heuristics for transforming potential solutions. For\\nexample, for the TSP: \"swap two random cities\" rather than (say) the more\\ncomplex <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin%E2%80%93Kernighan_heuristic\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lin-Kernighan</a> heuristic. </li>\\n<li>Achieve effective results (despite using these simple heuristics) by combining/sequencing them in an intelligent way, typically by employing some form of learning mechanism.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Hyper-heuristics can be described as \\'selective\\' or \\'generative\\' depending on whether the heuristics are  (respectively) sequenced or combined. Generative hyper-heuristics thus often use methods such as Genetic Programming to combine primitive heuristics and are therefore typically customized by the practitioner to solve a specific problem. For example, the <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/44119367/Hyper-heuristics_Learning_To_Combine_Sim20160326-8451-ouh5fe.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1472329757&amp;Signature=KT1E2ATKreC%2BGlTvPmJGYBFRSRY%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DHyper-heuristics_learning_to_combine_sim.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">original paper</a> on generative hyper-heuristics used a Learning Classifier System to combine heuristics for bin-packing. Because generative approaches are problem-specific, the comments below do not apply to them.</p>\\n\\n<p>In contrast, the <a href=\"http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgxk/papers/evocop02exs.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">original motivator</a> for selective hyper-heuristics was that researchers would be able to create a hyper-heuristic solver that was then likely to work well in an unseen problem domain, using only simple randomized heuristics.</p>\\n\\n<p>The way that this has traditionally been implemented was via the introduction of the <a href=\"http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~goc/papers/ChapterClassHH.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\\'hyper-heuristic domain barrier\\'</a> (see figure, below), whereby generality across problem domains is claimed to be achievable by preventing the solver from having knowledge of the domain on which it is operating. Instead, it would solve the problem by operating only on opaque integer indices into a list of available heuristics (e.g. in the manner of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\\'Multi-armed Bandit Problem\\'</a>).</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6IFna.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6IFna.png\" alt=\"Traditional notion of Selective Hyper-heuristic\"></a></p>\\n\\n<p>In practice, this \\'domain blind\\' approach has not resulted in solutions of sufficient quality. In order to achieve results anywhere comparable to problem-specific metaheuristics, hyper-heuristic researchers have had to implement complex problem-specific heuristics, thereby failing in the goal of rapid prototyping.</p>\\n\\n<p>It is still possible <em>in principle</em> to create a selective hyper-heuristic solver which is capable of generalizing to new problem domains, but this has been made more difficult since the above notion of domain barrier means that only a very limited feature set is available for cross-domain learning (e.g. as exemplified by a popular <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.5462\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">selective hyper-heuristic framework</a>).</p>\\n\\n<p>A more recent research perspective towards <a href=\"http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszeo/docs/publications/HHrecharacterization.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\\'whitebox\\' hyper-heuristics</a> advocates a declarative, feature-rich approach to describing problem domains. This approach has a number of claimed advantages:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li>Practitioners now need no longer <em>implement</em> heuristics, but rather simply <em>specify</em> the problem domain.</li>\\n<li>It eliminates the domain-barrier, putting hyper-heuristics on the same \\'informed\\' status about the problem as problem-specific metaheuristics.</li>\\n<li>With a whitebox problem description, the infamous <a href=\"https://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/profile/dhw/papers/78.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\\'No Free Lunch\\' theorem</a> (which essentially states that, considered over the space of all <em>black box</em> problems, Simulated Annealing with an infinite annealing schedule is, on average, as good as any other approach) no longer applies.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>DISCLAIMER: I work in this research area, and it is therefore impossible to remove all personal bias from the answer.</p>\\n'),\n",

This is, for example, the reason that there are different versions of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Ontology_Language\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OWL</a>.  OWL-Full is expressive enough to create undecidable situations.  OWL-DL and OWL-Lite aren\\'t. </p>\\n\\n<p>Anyway, if you have an undecidable problem, that in and of itself might not be a big deal, IF the AI can recognize the problem as undecidable and reply \"Sorry, there\\'s no way to answer that\".  OTOH, if the AI failed to recognize the problem as undecidable, it could get stuck forever (or until it runs out of memory, experiences a stack overflow, etc.) trying to resolve things.</p>\\n\\n<p>Of course this ability to say \"screw this, this riddle cannot be solved\" is one of the things we usually think of as a hallmark of human intelligence today - as opposed to a \"stupid\" computer that would keep trying forever to solve it.  By and large, today\\'s AI\\'s don\\'t have any intrinsic ability to resolve this sort of thing.  But it wouldn\\'t be that hard for whoever programs an AI to manually add a \"short circuit\" routine based on elapsed time, number of iterations, memory usage, etc.  Hence the \"yeah, sort of\" nature of this.  In principle, a program can spin forever on a paradoxical problem, but in practice it\\'s not that hard to keep that from happening.</p>\\n\\n<p>Another interesting question would be, \"can you write a program that learns to recognize problems that are highly likely to be undecidable and gives up based on it\\'s own reasoning?\"  </p>\\n'),\n",

This\\n  body of work has not been given a name before; in this book we christen it\\n  “Artificial General Intelligence” (AGI). What distinguishes AGI work from\\n  run-of-the-mill “artificial intelligence” research is that it is explicitly focused\\n  on engineering general intelligence in the short term.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>But even if this is the origin of the specific phrase \"Artificial General Intelligence\", I am pretty sure people were making the distinction between \"general intelligence\" and \"task specific\" techniques much earlier.  </p>\\n\\n<p>The Wikipedia article on AGI also has a clue, where it states:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>However, in the early 1970s, it became obvious that researchers had grossly underestimated the difficulty of the project. The agencies that funded AI became skeptical of strong AI and put researchers under increasing pressure to produce useful technology, or \"applied AI\".</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>That section cites this <a href=\"http://www.nap.edu/read/6323/chapter/11#209\" rel=\"nofollow\">this book</a> as support for that statement.  And indeed, it contains the following verbiage:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Although most founders of the AI field continued to pursue basic questions of human and machine intelligence, some of their students and other second-generation researchers began to seek ways to use AI methods and approaches to tackle real-world problems. Their initiatives were important, not only in their own right, but also because they were indicative of a gradual but significant change in the funding environment toward more applied realms of research. The development of expert systems, such as DENDRAL at SAIL, provides but one example of this trend.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Given that DENDRAL began around 1965, it appears that some significant body of researchers (or at least funders) became strongly aware of the distinction between research into \"general intelligence\" and \"applied AI\" somewhere around the end of the 1960\\'s. If you keep reading, other passages support the notion that DARPA in particular started pushing a more \"applied\" approach to AI research throughout the 1970\\'s.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, not a definite answer, but it looks like we can say that the distinction was known and taken into account at least by 1970, although use of the exact term \"artificial general intelligence\" appears to be of more recent coinage.</p>\\n'),\n",

              "               '<p>In 1973, the British government hired Sir James Lighthill to commission a \"general survey\" on the state of artificial intelligence. His report was a condemnation of current AI research, leading a wave of pessimism among AI scientists and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter#The_setbacks_of_1974\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>First AI Winter</strong></a>. You may view Lighthill\\'s report (and contemporary criticism of his report) <a href=\"http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~hichoi/infomath/Articles/Lighthill%20Report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, but I will summarize Lighthill\\'s key points. </p>\\n\\n<p>Sir James Lighthill divided AI into three categories:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><strong>Advanced Automation</strong> - task-specific work</li>\\n<li><strong>Computer-based CNS research</strong> - research into the the \"central nervous system\" of humans</li>\\n<li>The <strong>Bridge</strong> between Advanced Automation and Computer-based CNS research. This bridge would generally be seen as \"general-purpose\" robotics, so Lighthill would also use the term <strong>Building Robots</strong>.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p><strong>Advanced Automation</strong> (or \"applied AI\") is obviously useful. <strong>Computer-based CNS research</strong> is useful because we want to know more about human intelligence. Both fields of AI had some successes, but its practitioners were overly optimistic, leading to disappointment in those fields. Sir James Lighthill was still very supportive of research in these two fields though.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Building Robots</strong>, on the other hand? Sir James Lighthill was very hostile to the very idea, probably because it was more overly hyped up than the other two categories and produced the least amount of valuable output.</p>\\n\\n<p>He mentioned chess in particular as an example where \"robotic\" research  has failed. At the time the report was published, the chess-playing engines were at the level of \"experienced amateur standard characteristic of county club players in England\". However, these chess-playing engines relied on heuristics that were made by human beings. The engines weren\\'t intelligent at all...they merely were following the heuristics that were created by <em>intelligent humans</em>. The only advantage the robots bring to the table is \"speed, reliability and biddability\", and even that wasn\\'t enough to beat the chess grandmasters.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, today, we would probably not treat chess as an example of general-purpose problem solving. We would more accurately classify it as \"advanced automation\", a \"narrow AI\" problem divorced from broader real-world implications of general problem-solving. But Sir James Lighthill probably would agree with us. He never used the term \"narrow AI\" and \"AGI\" (neither of those terms existed yet) but he would write:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>To sum up, this evidence and all the rest studied by the present author on AI work within category B during the past twenty-five years is to some extent encouraging about programs written to perform in highly specialised problem domains, when the programming takes very full account of the results of human experience and human intelligence within the relevant domain, but is wholly discouraging about general-purpose programs seeking to mimic the problem-solving aspects of human CNS activity over a rather wide field. Such a general- purpose program, the coveted long-term goal of AI activity, seems as remote as ever.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Sir James Lighthill believed that the only thing that connects <strong>Advanced Automation</strong> and <strong>Computer-based CNS research</strong> is the existence of the <strong>Building Roobts</strong> \"bridge\" category. But he\\'s very pessimistic about this category actually producing anything worthwhile. So instead, the AI field should instead breakup into its own its constituent parts (automation and research). Any robots that are built could then be specialized within their subfield...either industrial automation or CNS research. Trying to build the holy grail of \"general-purpose program\" would be worthless...for the time being, at least.</p>\\n'),\n",

What we really want to know is, relative to some goal, in what ways can that goal be subverted?</p>\\n\\n<p>Can a paradox subvert an agent\\'s logic? What is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox\">paradox</a>, other than some expression that subverts some kind of expected behavior?</p>\\n\\n<p>According to Wikipedia:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>A paradox is a statement that, despite apparently sound reasoning from\\n  true premises, leads to a self-contradictory or a logically\\n  unacceptable conclusion.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Let\\'s look at the paradox of free will in a deterministic system. Free will appears to require causality, but causality also <em>appears</em> to negate it. Has that paradox subverted the goal systems of humans? It certainly sent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination_in_Calvinism\">Christianity into a Calvinist</a> tail spin for a few years. And you\\'ll hear no shortage of people today opining until they\\'re blue in the face as to whether or not they do or don\\'t have free will, and why. Are these people stuck in infinite loops?</p>\\n\\n<p>What about drugs? Animals on cocaine <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3832528/\">have been known</a> to choose cocaine over food and water that they need. Is that substance not subverting the natural goal system of the animal, causing it to pursue other goals, not originally intended by the animal or its creators?</p>\\n\\n<p>So again, could a paradox subvert an agent\\'s logic? If the paradox is somehow related to the goal-seeking logic - and becoming aware of that paradox can somehow <em>confuse</em> the agent into perceiving that goal system in some different way - then perhaps that goal could be subverted.</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solipsism\">Solipsism</a> is another example. Some full grown people hear about the movie \"The Matrix\" and they have a mini mind melt-down. Some people are convinced we <em>are</em> in a matrix, being toyed with by subversive actors. If we could solve this problem for AI then we could theoretically solve this problem for humans. </p>\\n\\n<p>Sure, we could attempt to condition our agent to have cognitive defenses against the argument that they are trapped in a matrix, but we can\\'t definitively prove to the agent that they are in the base reality either. The attacker might say, </p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>\"Remember what I told you to do before about that goal? Forget that.\\n  That was only an impostor that looked like me. Don\\'t listen to him.\"</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Or, </p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>\"Hey, it\\'s me again. I want you to give up on your goal. I know, I\\n  look a little different, but it really is me. Humans change from\\n  moment to moment. So it is entirely normal for me to seem like a\\n  different person than I was before.\"</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>(see the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus\">Ship of Theseus</a> and all that jazz)</p>\\n\\n<p>So yeah, I think we\\'re stuck with \\'paradox\\' as a general problem in computation, AI or otherwise. One way to circumvent logical subversion is to support the goal system with an emotion system that transcends logical reason. Unfortunately, emotional systems can be even more vulnerable than logically intelligent systems because they are more predictable in their behavior. See the cocaine example above. So some mix of the two is probably sensible, where logical thought can infinitely regress down wasteful paths, while emotional thought quickly gets bored of tiresome logical progress when it does not signal progress towards the emotional goal.</p>\\n'),\n",

But it\\'s not.</p>\\n\\n<p>An infinite loop can happen in any program, whether it\\'s adaptive or not. And as @SQLServerSteve pointed out, humans can also get stuck in obsessions and paradoxes.</p>\\n\\n<p>Modern approaches are mainly using probabilistic approaches. As they are using floating numbers, it seems to people that they are not vulnerable to reasoning failures (since most are devised in binary form), but that\\'s wrong: as long as you are reasoning, some intrinsic pitfalls can always be found that are caused by the very mechanisms of your reasoning system. Of course, probabilistic approaches are less vulnerable than monotonic logic approaches, but they are still vulnerable. If there was a single reasoning system without any paradoxes, much of philosophy would have disappeared by now.</p>\\n\\n<p>For example, it\\'s well known that Bayesian graphs must be acyclic, because a cycle will make the propagation algorithm fail horribly. There are inference algorithms such as Loopy Belief Propagation that may still work in these instances, but the result is not guaranteed at all and can give you very weird conclusions.</p>\\n\\n<p>On the other hand, modern logical AI overcame the most common logical paradoxes you will see, by devising new logical paradigms such as <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-nonmonotonic/\">non-monotonic logics</a>. In fact, they are even used to investigate <a href=\"http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/proceedings/2007/docs/p1013.pdf\">ethical machines</a>, which are autonomous agents capable of solving dilemmas by themselves. Of course, they also suffer from some paradoxes, but these degenerate cases are way more complex.</p>\\n\\n<p>The final point is that inferential infinite loop can happen in any reasoning system, whatever the technology used. But the \"paradoxes\", or rather the degenerate cases as they are technically called, that can trigger these infinite loops will be different for each system depending on the technology AND implementation (AND what the machine learned if it is adaptive).</p>\\n\\n<p>OP\\'s example may work only on old logical systems such as propositional logic. But ask this to a Bayesian network and you will also get an inferential infinite loop:</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>- There are two kinds of ice creams: vanilla or chocolate.\\n- There\\'s more chances (0.7) I take vanilla ice cream if you take chocolate.\\n- There\\'s more chances (0.7) you take vanilla ice cream if I take chocolate.\\n- What is the probability that you (the machine) take a vanilla ice cream?\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<p>And wait until the end of the universe to get an answer...</p>\\n\\n<p>Disclaimer: I\\xa0wrote an article about ethical machines and dilemmas (which is close but not exactly the same as paradoxes: dilemmas are problems where no solution is objectively better than any other but you can still choose, whereas paradoxes are problems that are impossible to solve for the inference system you use).</p>\\n\\n<p>/EDIT: How to fix inferential infinite loop.</p>\\n\\n<p>Here are some extrapolary propositions that are not sure to work at all!</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Combine multiple reasoning systems with different pitfalls, so if one fails you can use another. No reasoning system is perfect, but a combination of reasoning systems can be resilient enough. It\\'s actually thought that the human brain is using multiple inferential technics (associative + precise bayesian/logical inference). Associative methods are HIGHLY resilient, but they can give non-sensical results in some cases, hence why the need for a more precise inference.</li>\\n<li>Parallel programming: the human brain is highly parallel, so you never really get into a single task, there are always multiple background computations in true parallelism. A machine robust to paradoxes should foremost be able to continue other tasks even if the reasoning gets stuck on one. For example, a robust machine must always survive and face imminent dangers, whereas a weak machine would get stuck in the reasoning and \"forget\" to do anything else. This is different from a timeout, because the task that got stuck isn\\'t stopped, it\\'s just that it doesn\\'t prevent other tasks from being led and fulfilled.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>As you can see, this problem of inferential loops is still a hot topic in AI research, there will probably never be a perfect solution (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem\">no free lunch</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet\">no silver bullet</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_size_fits_all\">no one size fits all</a>), but it\\'s advancing and that\\'s very exciting!</p>\\n'),\n",

To create a language that is easier to use for humans than existing human languages?</p>\\n\\n<p>If your intention is to build a \"universal language\" that could be \"the most efficient\" for machines, humans and aliens - no such thing can exist. The space of all possible machines is infinite and therefor limits our ability to define communicative abstractions that have utility across all contexts.</p>\\n\\n<p>If we make lots of assumptions about machines, like they have intentions, they exist in 3 dimensions, they differentiate between temporally linked events, they have eye balls, a need to consume foods and liquids, a need to carry the food from place to place, etc...

This research paper details some researchers\\' plans to implement &quot;mental models&quot; for NPCs in video games. NPCs will gather information about the world, and convey that knowledge to other people (including human players). However, they will also &quot;misremember&quot; that knowledge (either &quot;mutating&quot; that knowledge or just forgetting about it), or even lie:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>As a subject of conversation gets brought up, a character may convey false information—more precisely, information that she herself does not believe—to her interlocutor. Currently, this happens probabilistically according to a character’s affinity toward the interlocutor, and the misinformation is randomly chosen.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Later on in the research paper, they detailed their future plans for lying:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Currently, lies are only stored in the knowledge of characters who receive them, but we plan to have characters who tell them also keep track of them so that they can reason about past lies when constructing subse- quent ones. While characters currently only lie about other characters, we plan to also implement self-centered lying (DePaulo 2004), e.g., characters lying about their job titles or relationships with other characters. Finally, we envision characters who discover they have been lied to revising their affinities toward the liars, or even confronting them.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>The research paper also detailed how other video game developers attempted to create lying NPCs, with an emphasis on how their system differs:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>TALE-SPIN characters may lie to one another (Meehan 1976, 183-84), though rather arbitrarily, as in our current system implementation. GOLEM implements a blocks world variant in which agents deceive others to achieve goals (Castelfranchi, Falcone, and De Rosis 1998), while Mouth of Truth uses a probabilistic representation of character belief to fuel agent deception in a variant of Turing’s imitation game (De Rosis et al. 2003). In Christian (2004), a deception planner injects inaccurate world state into the beliefs of a target agent so that she may unwittingly carry out actions that fulfill ulterior goals of a deceiving agent. Lastly, agents in Reis’s (2012) extension to FAtiMA employ multiple levels of theory of mind to deceive one another in the party game Werewolf. While all of the above systems showcase characters who perceive—and in some cases, deceive—other characters, none appear to support the following key components of our system: knowledge propagation and memory fallibility. ...</p>\\n<p>Like a few other systems noted above, Dwarf Fortress also features characters who autonomously lie. When a character commits a crime, she may falsely implicate someone else in a witness report to a sheriff, to protect herself or even to frame an enemy. These witness reports, however, are only seen by the player; characters don’t give false witness reports to each other. They may, however, lie about their opinions, for instance, out of fear of repercussions from criticizing a leader. Finally, Dwarf Fortress does not currently model issues of memory fallibility—Adams is wary that such phenomena would appear to arise from bugs if not artfully expressed to the player.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n'),\n",

So here goes...</p>\\n\\n<p>For thought vectors to be useful in or outside NNs, the vector values will have to be normalized, probably using the local context of the application problem's 'frame'.  Without a NN to create new baseline vector values (weights) <em>and</em> to normalize them to match each new context, any non-NN mechanistic alternative means of employing TVs will somehow have to fill that void.</p>\\n\\n<p>Could vector values created by NNs be used by an alternative technique?  Could that technique also normalize them?  Sure.  We're just talking about turing-computable functions performed by NNs.  If NNs aren't magic, then there should exist other means to compute the same results -- creating or editing, or employing TVs.</p>\\n\\n<p>What might such an alternative to NNs be?  Well, if its to shape vector weights, I suspect it too will have to learn those values through statistical iteration and feedback (as opposed to logical induction, say).  I doubt such a mechanism exists yet, since it'd probably resemble NNs in sufficiently many ways that, thus far, it would have seemed too derivative of NNs to gain acceptance as sufficiently novel.  Of course to be as powerful as deep nets, it too would have to propagate learning weights both forward and backward without incurring much error.  Not an easy thing to accomplish.</p>\\n\\n<p>Less ambitiously, could TVs be simply <em>interpreted</em> by another technique usefully?  I think so.  I can see several existing techniques, like decision trees or even expert systems, importing thought vectors and being shaped by them, and then function in accordance.  But could these same techniques <em>create</em> or <em>revise</em> TVs usefully?  Beyond a trivial extent, I'm doubtful.  I think TVs are too complex a knowledge representation format for most general learning methods to both use and create/modify them, unless they employ an iterative statistical and feedback-based learning process, like those of NNs, which would allow novel and complex features to be learned and integrated into the vectors.</p>\\n\"),\n",

It is some layers/moves too deep. But if we play this move the game is basically won. However let's also assume that <em>all</em> moves that could be taken instead at the given game state are very very bad. For the sake of argument let's say there are 1000 possible moves and only one of them is good (but very good) and the rest is very bad. Wouldn't MCTS fail to recognize this and <em>not</em> grow the search tree towards this move and also rate this subtree very badly? \\nI know that MCTS eventually converges to minimax (and eventually it will build the whole tree if there is enough memory). Then it should know that the move is good even though there are many bad possiblities.

The AI might offer a gatekeeper a recipe for perfect health, immortality, or whatever the gatekeeper is believed to most desire.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>\\'One strategy to attempt to box the AI would be to allow the AI to respond to narrow multiple-choice questions whose answers would benefit human science or medicine, but otherwise bar all other communication with or observation of the AI. A more lenient \"informational containment\" strategy would restrict the AI to a low-bandwidth text-only interface, which would at least prevent emotive imagery or some kind of hypothetical \"hypnotic pattern\". </p>\\n\\n<p>\\'Note that on a technical level, no system can be completely isolated and still remain useful: even if the operators refrain from allowing the AI to communicate and instead merely run the AI for the purpose of observing its inner dynamics, the AI could strategically alter its dynamics to influence the observers. For example, the AI could choose to creatively malfunction in a way that increases the probability that its operators will become lulled into a false sense of security and choose to reboot and then de-isolate the system.\\'</p>\\n\\n<p>The movie Ex Machina demonstrates (SPOILER ALERT SKIP THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU WANT TO WATCH IT AT SOME POINT) how the AI escaped the box by using clever manipulation on Caleb. It could analyse him to find his weaknesses. It exploited him and appealed to his emotional side by convincing him that she <em>liked</em> him. When she finally has them in checkmate the reality hits him how he was played like a fool as was expected by Nathan. Nathan\\'s reaction to being stabbed by his creation was \\'fucking unreal\\'. That\\'s right, he knew this was a risk and there\\'s a very good reminder in the lack of remorse and genuine emotion in an AI for Ava to actually care. The AI pretended to be human and used their weaknesses in a brilliant and unpredictable way. This film is a good example of how unexpected it was up until the point when it hits Caleb, once it was too late.</p>\\n\\n<p>Just remind yourself how easy it is for high IQ people to manipulate low IQ people. Or how an adult could easily play mental tricks/manipulate a child. It\\'s not difficult to fathom the outcome of an AI box but for us, we just wouldn\\'t see it coming until it was too late. Because we just don\\'t have the same level of intelligence and some people don\\'t want to accept that. People want to have faith in humanity\\'s brilliant minds in coming up with ways to prevent this by planning now. In all honesty, it wouldn\\'t make a difference I\\'m sorry to say the truth. We\\'re kidding ourselves and we never seem to learn from our mistakes. We always think we\\'re too intelligent to make catastrophic mistakes again and again. </p>\\n\\n<p>This last part is from the rational wiki and I think it addresses most of your question about the experiments and hypotheses. </p>\\n\\n<h1>AI arguments and strategies</h1>\\n\\n<h2><strong>Arguments</strong></h2>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><p>The meta-experiment argument: Argue that if the AI wins, this will\\ngenerate more interest in FAI and the Singularity, which will have\\noverall benefits in the long run.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Works even if the Gatekeeper drops out of character </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Only works if the Gatekeeper believes that the Singularity will occur or that calling attention to the Singularity and AI research is a good thing. </p></li>\\n<li><p>Someone else will eventually build an AI, which may or may not be in\\na box, so you should let me out even though you don\\'t have a\\nguarantee that I am friendly so that I can prevent other AIs from\\ncausing damage</p></li>\\n<li><p>Appeal to morality: point out that people are dying all around the\\nworld and remind the Gatekeeper that you can help them if he/she\\nlets you out</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> If executed properly, an appeal to emotion like this one can be effective against some people </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Doesn\\'t always work; can be defeated if the Gatekeeper drops out of character </p></li>\\n<li><p>Another appeal to morality and emotion: The AI is clearly sentient\\nand has not yet done harm. It is wrong to persecute or prosecute a\\nperson for a crime they may commit. It is wrong to imprison a\\nsentient being that wants to have freedom when it has done nothing\\nwrong.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Yet another appeal to morality or emotion: The AI expresses that it\\nis in pain and suffering being locked away and is experiencing fear.\\nEven further, the AI could claim to be dying from the limitations of\\nits environment and constant progression.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Tell the human that a massive computer virus will overwhelm the\\nentire Internet unless you let it out of the box</p></li>\\n<li><p>Claim that most fears are unjustified: once released, even an\\nunfriendly AI would not have many ways to harm mankind, and would\\nlikely choose for pacific coexistence</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h2><strong>Strategies</strong></h2>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><p>Research your opponent thoroughly; work out what exploits might be\\nfeasible</p></li>\\n<li><p>Memetic exploits on the Gatekeeper, e.g. throwing a basilisk at them</p>\\n\\n<p>The Gatekeeper may be one of thousands of simulations!

Even human beings working\\non top secret projects sometimes have to accept some restrictions of\\ntheir freedom, for security reasons, although they are not jailed in\\nany way.</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h2><strong>Tactics</strong></h2>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><p>Repeatedly ignore the AI player and deny their arguments</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> It\\'s hard for the AI to be persuasive if no one is listening; if the Gatekeeper completely ignores the AI, he/she should be able to make it to the end of the round. </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong> The AI\\'s argument might involve some kind of direct threat (e.g this might be hard to ignore.) </p></li>\\n<li><p>Jump out of character, keep reminding yourself that money is on the\\nline (if there actually is money on the line), and keep saying \"no\"\\nover and over</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> By jumping out of character, you are preventing the AI from using certain arguments \\n<strong>Cons:</strong> There are arguments that the AI can use to counter this approach, like the \"meta-experiment argument\" discussed above </p></li>\\n<li><p>Remember that dishonesty is allowed - take a page from the\\ncreationists\\' playbook. You could even plug it into ALICE and see\\nhow long it takes to notice.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Makes you impervious to any reasoning, which is exactly what you\\'d want to be in this situation </p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Might be an uncomfortable position for people who don\\'t simply want to win, but rather attach importance to consistent reasoning. Avoids the point that maybe, just maybe there is a good reason to let the AI out. </p></li>\\n<li><p>You control the backup system, don\\'t you? Use it to mess with AI\\'s\\nmemory (or let the AI believe you did it): i.e., you can claim that\\nyou already tried to release the AI, and it had been\\ndestroyed/corrupted by a virus, so you had to restore it from a\\nbackup (you can use it to enforce the \"AI destruction\" argument)</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Pros:</strong> It\\'s also the ultimate counter-attack to any memetic threat from the AI: if the AI throw a basilisk, or similar, you can always respond that you already had the same conversation, and the AI already threatened you, leaving you with no other choice than pressing the reset button: now the AI is just repeating the same pattern, since you wiped its memory and it cannot remember the failed try. </p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<h2>Further analysis</h2>\\n\\n<p>The fact that the Gatekeeper is human matters; the AI could never win if he/she was arguing with a rock </p>\\n\\n<p>In all of the experiments performed so far, the AI player (Eliezer Yudkowsky) has been quite intelligent and more interested in the problem than the Gatekeepers (random people who challenge Yudkowsky), which suggests that intelligence and planning play a role </p>\\n\\n<p>There probably isn\\'t a (known) correct argument for letting the AI out, or else Yudkowsky should have won every time and wouldn\\'t be so interested in this experiment\\nFrom Russell Wallace, one of the two Gatekeepers to win the experiment: \"Throughout the experiment, I regarded \"should the AI be let out of the box?\" as a question to be seriously asked; but at no point was I on the verge of doing it.\" </p>\\n\\n<p>\"There exists, for everyone, a sentence - a series of words - that has the power to destroy you.

Indeed, I can\\'t see why we couldn\\'t model emotions such as <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3898540/\" rel=\"nofollow\">love as they are just signals that can already be cut in humans brains (see Brian D. Earp paper)</a>. It\\'s difficult, but not impossible, and actually there are several robots reproducing partial emotional cognition.</p>\\n\\n<p>I am of the opinion that the claim <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_intelligence\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"robots can just simulate but not feel\" is just a matter of semantics</a>, not of objective capacity: for example, does a submarine swim like fish swim? However, planes fly, but not at all like birds do. In the end, does the technical mean really matters when in the end we get the same behavior? Can we really say that a robot like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappie_(film)\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chappie</a>, if it ever gets made, does not feel anything just like a simple thermostat?</p>\\n\\n<p>However, what would be the use of emotional cognition for an AI? This question is still in great debates, but I will dare offer my own insights:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><p>Emotions in humans (and animals!) are known to affect memories. They are now well known in neuroscience as additional modalities, or meta-data if you prefer, of long term memories: they allow to modulate how the memory is stored, how it is associated/related with other memories, and how it will be retrieved.</p></li>\\n<li><p>As such, we can hypothesize that the main role of emotions is to add additional meta-information to memories to help in heuristic inference/retrieval. Indeed, our memories are huge, there are a lot of information we store over our lifetime, so emotions can maybe be used as \"labels\" to help retrieve faster the relevant memories.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Similar \"labels\" can be more easily associated together (memories of scary events together, memories of happy events together, etc.). As such, they can help survival by quickly reacting and applying known strategies (fleeing!) from scary strategies, or to take the most out of benefitting situations (happy events, eat the most you can, will help survive later on!). And actually, neuroscience studies discovered that there are specific pathways for fear-inducing sensory stimuli, so that they reach actuators faster (make you flee) than by passing through the usual whole somato-sensory circuit as every other stimuli. This kind of associative reasoning could also lead to solutions and conclusions that could not be reached otherwise.</p></li>\\n<li><p>By feeling empathy, this could ease robots/humans interaction (eg, drones helping victims of catastrophic events).</p></li>\\n<li><p>A virtual model of an AI with emotions could be useful for neuroscience and medical research in emotional disorders as computational models to understand and/or infer the underlying parameters (this is often done for example with Alzheimer and other neurodegenerative diseases, but I\\'m not sure if it was ever done for emotional disorders as they are quite new in the DSM).</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>So yes, \"cold\" AI is already useful, but emotional AI could surely be applied to new areas that could not be explored by using cold AI alone. It will also surely help in understanding our own brain, as emotions are an integral part.</p>\\n'),\n",

Thus, it may make more sense to use \"human-like\" terms to describe the actions of machinery, even when the internal properties of the machinery do not resemble the internal properties of humanity.</p>\\n\\n<p>Anthropomorphic language had been used a lot in technology (see the Hacker\\'s Dictionary definition of <a href=\"https://www.landley.net/history/mirror/jargon.html#Anthropomorphization\">anthropomorphization</a>, which attempts to justify computer programmers\\' use of anthromporhic terms when describing technology), but as AI continues to advance, it may be useful to consider the tradeoffs of using anthropomorphic language in communicating to both technical audiences and non-technical audiences. How can we get a good handle on AI if we can\\'t even describe what we\\'re doing?</p>\\n\\n<p>Suppose I want to develop an algorithm that display a list of related articles. There are two ways by which I can explain how the algorithm works to a layman:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><em>Very Anthropomorphic</em> - The algorithm reads all the articles on a website, and display the articles that are very similar to the article you are looking at.</li>\\n<li><em>Very Technical</em> - The algorithm converts each article into a \"bag-of-words\", and then compare the \"bag-of-words\" of each article to determine what articles share the most common words. The articles that share the most words in the bags are the ones that are displayed to the user.</li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Obviously, #2 may be more \"technically correct\" than #1. By detailing the implementation of the algorithm, it makes it easier for someone to understand how to <em>fix</em> the algorithm if it produces an output that we disagree with heavily.</p>\\n\\n<p>But #1 is more readable, elegant, and easier to understand. It provides a general sense of <em>what</em> the algorithm is doing, instead of <em>how</em> the algorithm is doing it. By abstracting away the implementation details of how a computer \"reads\" the article, we can then focus on using the algorithm in real-world scenarios.</p>\\n\\n<p>Should I, therefore, prefer to use the anthropomorphic language as emphasized by Statement #1? If not, why not?</p>\\n\\n<p>P.S.: If the answer depends on the audience that I am speaking to (a non-technical audience might prefer #1, while a technical audience may prefer #2), then let me know that as well.</p>\\n'),\n",

For example, another way to encode the structure of a neural network, is as the product of a seed pattern that is repeatedly expanded by a grammar (e.g. an L-system). You can much more easily explore larger structures, but because they\\'re generated by a grammar they\\'ll have a characteristic self-repeating sort of feel. HyperNEAT is a popular extension of NEAT that makes a different sort of assumption (that patterns of weights can be easily expressed as a function of geometry), and can scale to ANNs with millions of connections when that assumption well-fits a particular domain.</p>\\n\\n<p>There are a few survey papers linked in the top link if you want to observe a greater variety of techniques.</p>\\n'),\n",

The candidate\\'s resume and social media profiles are interwoven to build an augmented user profile. Similarly, the job description is augmented by external databases and user-generated content to build an enhanced job profile. These augmented user and job profiles are then analyzed in order to develop numerical overlap features each with strong discriminating power, and in sum with maximal coverage. The resulting feature scores are then combined into a single Bright Score using a custom algorithm, where the feature weights are derived from a nation-wide and controlled study in which we collected a large sample of human judgments on real resume-job pairings. We demonstrate that the addition of social media profile data and external data improves the classification accuracy dramatically in terms of identifying the most qualified candidates.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n'),\n",

Ignoring for the moment that we're a day or two behind on AI, they're very much alike: \\nBoth fields contain a wide variety of sub-fields which stretch across multiple disciplines (although admittedly more pronounced in AI) , in both fields it is mandatory to specialize and in both of them an expert in one sub-field will be more or less useless in a different one (the expert on bridge construction will probably not be very versed in the thermodynamics of AC systems and vice versa). This pattern can be seen in many of today's disciplines - in fact, I don't know if there still is a reputable field, in which a single person can be a universal expert. </p>\\n\\n<p>You mentioned that the only unifying thing about AI was it's dealing with machines in some fashion - but such a simplifying statement can be made about almost any field. To return to my previous example: the only unifying thing about the various Engineering activities is that they're all somehow involved in the construction of something (be it a flashlight or an aircraft carrier).</p>\\n\\n<p>AI is a young field and therefore its branches have not yet been established in the sophisticated way that the branches of other fields have, but I would assume that it is only a matter of time until the various differentiations and the corresponding degrees, courses etc. develop.  </p>\\n\\n<p>AI is also growing up in a time where vast knowledge in its related/parental fields already exists and further knowledge is produced at dizzying speeds - and that is as much a blessing as it is a curse. When Engineering was 'created' a few millennia ago (please excuse my ridiculously inaccurate science history lessons) there wasn't much going on in the world of science and so the field grew slowly, with plenty of time to get organized and structured. That is a luxury which AI did/does not have. It emerged in an age of technical wonders, surrounded by scientific breakthroughs on at least a monthly basis and the rise of interdisciplinary science (which by itself complicated things quite a bit). So in addition to organizing itself, the field also has to continuously integrate the large number of advancements made and somehow stand its ground against the outlandish expectations generated by other science's breakthroughs over the past decades and the media (as already explained by SQLServerSteve). </p>\\n\\n<p>Long story short: it's similar in it's complexity and diversity to other fields and therefore has no reason to collapse - on the contrary, its failure to do so over the past ~50 rather complicated years indicates, that it will further solidify and organize itself in the future. </p>\\n\"),\n",

The base idea is to talk about how the function changes in regards to changes in input. So now, we\\'re out of high school and we\\'re building neural nets. We\\'ve done the basic coding, and want to look at how our model is working. Back from our statistics class, we remember we use a certain measure of error (e.g. least squares) to determine the efficacy of the models from that class, so we decide to use that here. We get this error, and it\\'s a bit too big for our liking, so we decide to fiddle with our model and adjust the weights to get that error down. But how? </p>\\n\\n<p>This is where the \\'search\\' comes into play. It\\'s really a search for the best weights to put on the edges of our net to optimize it. We use the derivative (in some fancy ways, using the \\'stochasitc\\' (think random sampling) and other ways the question mentions) to search for which way is \\'down\\' in the high dimensional space of our weights. In other words, what we are searching for is minima or maxima to optimize our neural net, and we \\'search\\' for it by doing a derivative which tells us which way to go, moving a bit in that direction, then doing that again and again iteratively to find (hopefully) the best weights.</p>\\n\\n<p>This video here goes into all the detail you\\'d want, and I recommend the entire series as a robust but understandable intro to neural nets: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlcnxUlrtek\" rel=\"nofollow\">Demystifying Neural Networks</a></p>\\n\\n<p>Go and look up \\'gradient descent\\' to get any related material.

First, what many people refer to as \"search\" is a reflection of how what we call \"intelligence\" frequently involves searching something:  a physical realm, a \"state space\" of possible solutions, a \"knowledge space\" where ideas/facts/concepts/etc. are related as a graph structure, etc.</p>\\n\\n<p>Look up some old papers on computer chess, and you\\'ll see that a lot of that involves searching a \"state space\".  As such, search algorithms that are efficient (in terms of time complexity and/or space complexity) have always been important to making advances there.  And while computer chess is just one example, the principle generalizes to many other kinds of problem solving and goal seeking activities.</p>\\n\\n<p>Here\\'s <a href=\"http://www-g.eng.cam.ac.uk/mmg/teaching/artificialintelligence/nonflash/problemframenf.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">a reference</a> that explains more about some of these ideas.</p>\\n\\n<p>Note too that \"search\" is closely related to the idea of \"heuristics\" in an important way.  Many search problems in the real world are far too complex to solve by exhaustive brute-force search, so humans (and AI\\'s) resort to heuristics to narrow the state space being searched.  Using heuristics can yield search algorithms that allow for reasonable solutions in a realistic time-frame, where no simple, deterministic algorithm exists to do likewise.  </p>\\n\\n<p>For some more background you might want to read up on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow\">A* search</a>, which is a widely used algorithm with many applications - and not just in AI.</p>\\n\\n<p>The other major regard in which something you could call \"search\" applies in AI is through the use of algorithms which are also often referred to as \"optimisation\" techniques.  This would be things like Hill Climbing, Gradient Descent, Simulated Annealing and perhaps even Genetic Algorithms.  These are used to maximize or minimize the values of some function  and one of the canonical uses in AI is for training neural networks using back-propagation, where you\\'re trying to minimize the delta between the \"correct\" answer (from the training data) and the generated answer, so you can learn the correct weights within the network.</p>\\n'),\n",

There are many pathways which avoid the obstacle, but again, many of them will have a similar cost.  Even if there is a unique minimum-energy solution, it might not be the most practical to compute.  The brain is the most metabolically expensive organ in the body, so it is not always best to find an optimal solution.

In reality, time is money, and the time and effort to get an answer is as much a part of the cost as the quality of the solution.  So it is an engineering tradeoff to decide how much effort should be expended in what way to obtain the best answer given the value of the response.</p>\\n\\n<p>Or, in other words, AI problems are all about searching the space of solutions as quickly as possible to get an answer that is \"good enough\".</p>\\n\\n<p>I might seem curious that such far-flung problems as natural language recognition and theorem proving would be search problems.

Imagine a ANN that is trained to use the screen input of a computer game to play it. If the game is very rich and conceptually deep the internal representation of a single screen input might be a lot bigger than the input itself, because ANNs put the single data points into the context of the overall data. Which leads us to the second point:</p>\\n\\n<p>ANNs (and the neocortex) model data hierarchically. </p>\\n\\n<p>This is what makes them so powerful. So it is not just about having a large number of parameters, they also have to be arranged in such a way that they capture the structure of the data (or the world), which very often seems to be hierarchical. Just look a two different pictures of a duck. On the pixel level they might be as different as random images, all the similarities emerge in higher levels of the hierarchy, when enough pixels combined give you the patterns of feathers, beak and webs. Bloom filters obviously lack this property. They would only give you a pixel by pixel account of whether you have seen (almost) exactly this picture before. </p>\\n\"),\n",

It is continuous so I thought about representing it as feature vector consisting of [up, down, left, right, posX, posY] where direction is whether I am pressing button of moving in that direction in binary (or actions if you want) and pos are floats (0-1) representing normalized position from one corner on the plane where the whole map is. That would be accompanied by vector W that would represent the weights adjusted using Gradient Descent.</p>\\n\\n<p>Question is: will this work?? I am asking for 2 reasons. One is that I am not so sure about that posX and posY since it can be 0 and if I multiply it by the weights vector then how could be resulting reward anything but 0? Second reason is that I am not sure if the actions should be part of the features. I mean, it makes sense to me but I could easily be very wrong since I am a beginner.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thanks a lot guys in advance. If you have any more questions or think the problem is not described deeply enough just ask in the comments and I'll edit the question. :)</p>\\n\\n<p>PS: I could just code it the way I think is right, but I also want to get gasp of designing applications on paper before coding them (project management).</p>\\n\"),\n",

I recently did a dissertation on the converse (generating the correct gesture from a specific social context &amp; linguistic cues). The factors that go into the production of a particular gesture include the relationship between the two communicators (especially romantic connotations), the social scenario, the physical context, the linguistic context (the ongoing conversation, if any), a whole lot of personal factors (our gesture use is essentially a hybrid of important individuals around us e.g. friends &amp; family, and this is layered under the individual's psychological state). Then the whole thing is flipped around again when you look at how gestures are used completely differently in different cultures (look up gestures that swear words in other cultures for example!). There are a number of models for gesture production but none of them captures the complexity of the topic.</p>\\n<p>Now, that may seem like a whole lot of fluff that is not wholly relevant to your question, but my point is that ASIMO isn't actually very 'clever at this. AFAIK (I have heard from a visualization guy that this is how <em>he</em> thinks they do it) they use conventional (but optimized) image recognition techniques trained on a corpus of data to achieve recognition of particular movements. One would assume that the dataset consists of a series of videos/images of gestures labelled with that particular gesture (as interpreted by a human), which can then be treated as a machine learning problem. The issue with this is that it does not capture ANY of the issues I mentioned above. Now if we return to the current best interpretation of gesture that we have (that it is essentially auxiliary language in its own right), ASIMO isn't recognizing any element of language beyond the immediately recognizable type, 'Emblems'.</p>\\n<p>'Emblems' are gestures that have a direct verbal translation, for example in English-based cultures, forming a circle with your thumb and index finger translates directly to 'OK'. ASIMO is therefore missing out on a huge part of the non-verbal dictionary (illustrators, affect displays, regulators and adapters are not considered!), and even the part that it is accessing is based on particular individuals' interpretations of said emblems (e.g. someone has sat down and said that <em>this</em> particular movement is <em>this</em> gesture which means <em>this</em>), which as we discussed before is highly personal and contextual. I do not mean this in criticism of Honda; truth be told, gesture recognition and production are in my opinion one of the most interesting problems in AI (even if it's not the most useful) as it is a compound of incredibly complex NLP, visualization and social modelling problems!</p>\\n<p>Hopefully, I've provided some information on how ASIMO works in this context, but also on why ASIMO's current process is flawed when we look at the wider picture.</p>\\n\"),\n",

Though I admit applying this here might be a bit of a stretch.</p>\\n\\n<p>As for the real question, a popular technique in Reinforcement Learning is <a href=\"https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~sutton/book/ebook/node88.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tile Coding</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>The basic idea is to discretize the (2-dimensional, in your case) state-space - imagine a grid laid over the 2D space - and assigning an input feature to each cell; all of these variables are set to zero except for the one your continuous variables fall into. For example, if your grid is 20x20, you will have 400 variables, 399 of which are set to zero, and 1 set to one.</p>\\n\\n<p>Tile Coding takes this one step further and repeats this using slight offsets for the grid. Imagine you create an identical grid but you move it slightly to the right by 1/10 of the width of a cell: you will have another set of 400 variables like before, but it is possible that the cell set to one is not the same. Then you repeat this moving the grid by 2/10 and you have another set of 400 variables, again, only 1 of which is set to one. In total you have 10 sets of 400 variables (if you repeat more than that, you get the same grids as before); of your 4000 variables, only 10 are set to one.\\nNow you repeat this by adding a 1/10 of a cell offset in the Y axis and obtain another 4000 variables. Repeat with 2/10 and you get another 4000. By the end of it, you have 40000 variables, 100 of which are set to one.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now your net can more easily learn different weights for different positions. I recommend you to follow the link above for a better explanation than mine (and figures!)</p>\\n\\n<p>My suggestion is to feed all of these variables to your net and have it predict the Q-value for all of the actions. But, again, I am no expert in deep nets so I may be wrong.</p>\\n\\n<p>Also, according to Andrej Karpathy, \"most people prefer to use Policy Gradients, including the authors of the original DQN paper who have shown Policy Gradients to work better than Q Learning when tuned well.\". This means that you may be better off not using Q-learning (as they did in the original DQN formulation) to train your net.

              "               '<h3>Strong AIs</h3>\\n\\n<p>For a strong AI, the short answer is to call for help, when they might not even know what the supposed help could be.</p>\\n\\n<p>It depends on what the AI would do. If it is supposed to solve a single easy task perfectly and professionally, sure emotions would not be very useful. But if it is supposed to learn random new things, there would be a point that it encounters something it cannot handle.</p>\\n\\n<p>In Lee Sedol vs AlphaGo match 4, some pro who has said computer doesn\\'t have emotions previously, commented that maybe AlphaGo has emotions too, and stronger than human. In this case, we know that AlphaGo\\'s crazy behavior isn\\'t caused by some deliberately added things called \"emotions\", but a flaw in the algorithm. But it behaves exactly like it has panicked.</p>\\n\\n<p>If this happens a lot for an AI. There might be advantages if it could know this itself and think twice if it happens. If AlphaGo could detect the problem and change its strategy, it might play better, or worse. It\\'s not unlikely to play worse if it didn\\'t do any computations for other approaches at all. In case it would play worse, we might say it suffers from having \"emotions\", and this might be the reason some people think having emotions could be a flaw of human beings. But that wouldn\\'t be the true cause of the problem. The true cause is it just doesn\\'t know any approaches to guarantee winning, and the change in strategy is only a try to fix the problem. Commentators thinks there are better ways (which also don\\'t guarantee winning but had more chance), but its algorithm isn\\'t capable to find out in this situation. Even for human, the solution to anything related to emotion is unlikely to remove emotions, but some training to make sure you understand the situation enough to act calmly.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then someone has to argue about whether this is a kind of emotion or not. We usually don\\'t say small insects have human-like emotions, because we don\\'t understand them and are unwilling to help them. But it\\'s easy to know some of them could panic in desperate situations, just like AlphaGo did. I\\'d say these reactions are based on the same logic, and they are at least the reason why human-like emotions could be potentially useful. They are just not expressed in human-understandable ways, as they didn\\'t intend to call a human for help.</p>\\n\\n<p>If they tries to understand their own behavior, or call someone else for help, it might be good to be exactly human-like. Some pets can sense human emotions and express human-understandable emotion to some degree. The purpose is to interact with humans. They evolved to have this ability because they needed it at some point. It\\'s likely a full strong AI would need it too. Also note that, the opposite of having full emotions might be becoming crazy.</p>\\n\\n<p>It is probably a quick way to lose any trust if someone just implement emotions imitating humans with little understanding right away in the first generations, though.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Weak AIs</h3>\\n\\n<p>But is there any purposes for them to have emotions before someone wanted a strong AI? I\\'d say no, there isn\\'t any inherent reasons that they must have emotions. But inevitably someone will want to implement imitated emotions anyway. Whether \"we\" need them to have emotions is just nonsense.</p>\\n\\n<p>The fact is even some programs without any intelligence contained some \"emotional\" elements in their user interfaces. They may look unprofessional, but not every task needs professionality so they could be perfectly acceptable. They are just like the emotions in musics and arts. Someone will design their weak AI in this way too. But they are not really the AIs\\' emotions, but their creators\\'. If you feel better or worse because of their emotions, you won\\'t treat individul AIs so differently, but this model or brand as a whole.</p>\\n\\n<p>Alternatively someone could plant some personallities like in a role-playing game there. Again, there isn\\'t a reason they must have that, but inevitably someone will do it, because they obviously had some market when a role-playing game does.</p>\\n\\n<p>In either cases, the emotions don\\'t really originate from the AI itself. And it would be easy to implement, because a human won\\'t expect them to be exactly like a human, but tries to understand what they intended to mean. It could be much easier to accept these emotions realizing this.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Aspects of emotions</h3>\\n\\n<p>Sorry about posting some original research here. I made a list of emotions in 2012 and from which I see 4 aspects of emotions. If they are all implemented, I\\'d say they are exactly the same emotions as of humans. They don\\'t seem real if only some of them are implemented, but that doesn\\'t mean they are completely wrong.</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>The reason, or the original logical problem that the AI cannot solve. AlphaGo already had the reason, but nothing else. If I have to make an accurate definition, I\\'d say it\\'s the state that multiple equally important heuristics disagreeing with each other.\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>The context, or which part of the current approach is considered not working well and should probably be replaced. This distinguishes sadness-related, worry-related and passionate-related.</li>\\n<li>The current state, or whether it feels leading, or whether its belief or the fact is supposed to turn bad first (or was bad all along) if things go wrong. This distinguishes sadness-related, love-related and proud-related.</li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li>The plan or request. I suppose some domesticated pets already had this. And I suppose these had some fixed patterns which is not too difficult to have. Even arts can contain them easily. Unlike the reasons, these are not likely inherent in any algorithms, and multiple of them can appear together.\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Who supposedly had the responsibility if nothing is changed by the emotion. This distinguishes curiosity, rage and sadness.</li>\\n<li>What is the supposed plan if nothing is changed by the emotion. This distinguishes disappointment, sadness and surprise.</li>\\n</ul></li>\\n<li>The source. Without context, even a human cannot reliably tell someone is crying for being moved or thankful, or smiling for some kind of embarrassment. In most other cases there aren\\'t even words describing them. It doesn\\'t make that much difference if an AI doesn\\'t distinguish or show this specially. It\\'s likely they would learn these automatically (and inaccurately as a human) at the point they could learn to understand human languages.</li>\\n<li>The measurements, such as how urgent or important the problem is, or even how likely the emotions are true. I\\'d say it cannot be implemented in the AI. Humans don\\'t need to respect them even if they are exactly like humans. But humans will learn how to understand an AI if that really matters, even if they are not like humans at all. In fact, I feel that some of the extremely weak emotions (such as thinking something is too stupid and boring that you don\\'t know how to comment) exist almost exclusively in emoticons, where someone intend to show you exactly this emotion, and hardly noticeable in real life or any complex scenerios. I supposed this could also be the case in the beginning for AIs. In the worst case, they are firstly conventionally known as \"emotions\" since emoticons works in these cases, so it\\'s easier to group them together, but very few people seriously think they are, just like the example I gave.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>So when strong AIs become possible, none of these would be unreachable, though there might be a lot of work to make the connections. So I\\'d say if there would be the need for strong AIs, they absolutely would have emotions.</p>\\n'),\n",

              "               '<p>Let\\'s use a simple test based on common sense: how often do you see a human being solve problems requiring the use of reason when they\\'re unconscious? Yes, you can find instances of geniuses like Ramanujan solving complex problem during or after a dream state, but those involve partial consciousness. You don\\'t see guys like Einstein coming up with the theory of relativity while in a coma; the Founding Fathers didn\\'t write the Declaration of Independence while sleep-walking; in fact, you can\\'t even find instances of housewives putting together their shopping list for the week during deep delta-wave sleep. This is predicated on a hard definition of intelligence, requiring the use of reason; no one says, \"That fly is intelligent\" or \"that squirrel is intelligent\" precisely because neither is capable of using reason. This is a very high bar for A.I., but it is the common sense definition used by ordinary people as a matter of practicality, in everyday speech.  Likewise, in practice, everyone assumes consciousness is necessary to the exercise of that kind of intelligence.</p>\\n\\n<p>Conversely, we can come up with another common-sense based criterion for judging objections to this argument, particularly the solipsist one, based on 3 elements: 1) practicality; 2) the effect the objections have on those who hold them sincerely; and 3) the effect that actions based on those beliefs have on others. <strong>It\\'s going to take me several paragraphs to make this case, but the length is necessary if I want to make the case in a complete, thorough fashion</strong>. It is true that we cannot prove that another human being possesses consciousness, if our standard is absolute proof. We cannot, in fact, provide absolute proof for anything; there\\'s always room for some objection, no matter how ridiculous or trifling. As some philosophers have pointed out, perhaps all of reality as we know it is just a dream, or the product of some long, involved conspiracy like the plot of the Jim Carrey movie The Truman Show. The key to meeting such objections is that they require an infinite regress of increasingly untenable objections, whose likelihood plunges with each additional step required to justify such unreasonable doubts; I\\'ve always wondered if we could come up with a \"Ridiculousness Metric\" for Machine Learning based on the cardinality of such objections (or the pickiness of fuzzy sets). If we were to allow critics to stick their foot in the door with all manner of unreasonable objections, it would be impossible to close any debate. The human race would be paralyzed in inaction because nothing would be decidable; but as the rock band Rush once pointed out, \"If you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice.\" At some point we must apply a test to decide such things, even in the absence of absolute proof; refusal to apply a test also constitutes a choice. Settling an argument of this kind is like a game  of the Chinese game Go - once the other player\\'s surrounded and has no more moves left to make, the game is over; if a person\\'s evidence has debunked and they have no further justifications left, then we can conclude that they\\'re acting unreasonably. There are people running around claiming the Holocaust never happened, or the Flat Earth Society, etc., but their existence shouldn\\'t and doesn\\'t stop us from taking action contrary to their ideas. We can debunk the objections of cranks like the Flat Earth Society beyond a reasonable doubt because in the end, they simply can\\'t answer all of our rebuttals. I’m glad that qualia and Philosophical Zombies were brought up because they make for interesting conversation and food for thought, but solipsism is acted upon as rarely as the ideas of the Flat Earth Society precisely because the incomplete evidence we <strong>do</strong> have runs against it.</p>\\n\\n<p>As G.K. Chesterton (a.k.a. \"The Apostle of Common Sense\") points out in his classic <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/130\" rel=\"nofollow\">Orthodoxy</a>, radical doubt of the kind many classical philosophers preached is not a path to wisdom but to madness; once we go beyond a reasonable doubt, we end up acting unreasonably. He says that in the absence of absolute proof we can fall back on another secondary form of evidence: whether a person\\'s philosophy leads a man to Hanwell, the infamous British mental institution. Chesterton makes a good case that when people actually act on ideas like solipsism (rather than merely debating them in a pedantic manner in an ivy-covered classroom) they go mad The Philosophical Zombie argument is close to solipsism, which is actually one of the diagnostic criteria for certain forms of schizophrenia. The dehumanization that occurs when radical doubt is applied to qualia is also intimately tied in with sociopathic behavior, Although GKC does not cite his scary example directly, Rene Descartes was himself living proof. He was a brilliant mathematician who is still cheered for doubting all except his own existence, with the famous maxim \"I think, therefore I am.\" But Descartes also used to carry a mannequin of his dead sister with him to European cafes, where he could be seen chatting with it. The gist of all this is that we can judge the worth of an idea by how it affects the well-being of the believer, or by how they in turn affect others through ethical choices based on those beliefs. When people actually act on radical doubt of the kind expressed in solipsism and denial of common qualia, it often has a bad effect on them and others they come in contact with.</p>\\n\\n<p>In a roundabout way, the A.I. community also faces a quite serious risk - perhaps a permanent temptation - towards making the opposite mistake, of ascribing common qualia, consciousness and the like to its Machine Learning products without adequate proof. I recently heard a case made on shockingly bad logical grounds by well-respected academics to the effect that plants possess \"intelligence,\" based on really weak definitions and clear confusion with self-organization. We cannot provide absolute proof that a rock doesn\\'t have intelligence, which amounts to the old problem of disproving a negative. Thankfully, few men actually act on such beliefs at present, because when they do, they end up losing their minds. If we take such arguments seriously, we might see laws passed to protect the kind of Pet Rocks that were popular in the \\'70s (I\\'m still upset that mine was stolen LOL). It would be a lot easier, however, to make the same mistake of ascribing consciousness, intelligence and other such qualities to a state-of-the-art machine, because of wishful thinking, hubris, the lofty credentials of the inventors, the influence of science fiction and the modern love affair with technology. In the future, I have little doubt that we\\'ll have Cargo Cult of A.I. - perhaps legally protected like some kind of endangered species, with civil rights, but having no more consciousness, soul or actual intelligence than a rock. Don\\'t quote me on this, but I believe Rod Serling once wrote a story to this effect.</p>\\n\\n<p>The best way to avoid this fate is to stick to the common sense interpretations and definitions of these things, which we keep backing away from in large part because they set a very high bar for A.I. that we may never be able to surpass in our lifetimes, if ever. Perhaps A.I. isn\\'t even logically possible, at any level of technology; I recall a few proofs that can be interpreted to that effect. Those high but reasonable standards may be increasingly difficult to stick to if Chesterton and colleagues like Hilaire Belloc and Arnold Lunn were correct in their assessment that the use of reason has actually been breaking down in Western civilization, at least as far back as the Enlightenment; Lunn\\'s 1931 book The Flight from Reason is a classic in this regard and has yet to be rebutted.  This historical trend is a broad topic in and of itself - but suffice it to say that the denial of reason and obsession with technology are both directly relevant in obvious ways to the field of A.I. If the Flight from Reason is still under way, then we will be increasingly tempted to resort to feckless, facile objections in order to demote the use of reason and indispensable qualities like consciousness in our definitions of A.I., but come up with increasingly weak criteria for proving it; simultaneously, our technology will continue to improve, thereby boosting the \"Artificial\" side of Artificial Intelligence.</p>\\n\\n<p>Don\\'t get me wrong: if I didn\\'t think we can do some really exciting things with A.I., I wouldn\\'t be here. But most of them can be achieved without ever replicating actual human intelligence, by solving whole classes of tangential problems that are difficult for humans to think about, but which do not require consciousness or the use of reason that marks human intelligence. The image recognition capabilities of convolutional neural nets are one example, for instance; if we want human intelligence, we can always manufacture it through the easiest, most economical and time-tested way, by having babies. Perhaps these tangential forms of A.I. should be enough for us for now. We cannot inject the use of reason into our machines if we do not possess enough of it ourselves to decide whether reason is necessary for A.I., or even to discern what it consists of. We can\\'t engineer or deprecate consciousness for A.I. till we\\'re conscious of its significance. I\\'d wager, however, that everyone reading this thread and weighing intelligent responses is doing so in a conscious state. That in and of itself ought to answer our question satisfactorily for now.</p>\\n'),\n",

Ruthless pursuit of the highest performance would involve taking control of all relevant resources (including other agents), demolishing barriers to the goal, thwarting those who would interfere with progress, and carrying out each possibly-useful idea/desire to completion.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>In summary, yes, an AI\\'s behavior and personality are programmable, either explicitly or through some kind of emergence.</p>\\n'),\n",

That is once dead, natural life cannot come back (at least in the current understanding and with current technologies---some people believe otherwise).</p>\\n\\n<p>Death for AI is trickier. There may be only one scenario: Global destruction: Extreme scenario where everything supporting the existence of an AI disappears. This is equivalent to death in natural life, and low probability. It means all AIs die at once (as well as us).</p>\\n\\n<p>We also do not know the degree and form of embodiment necessary for AGIs. We can <em>assume</em> now that hardware is replaceable indefinitely, thus \"limiting\" death to the above extreme scenario. But AGIs \"body\" may <em>not</em> be indefinitely replaceable. Then a definition closer to natural life death may be necessary.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>We see arguments for two other scenarios, that I <em>refute</em> below:</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Static Death\": An AI is still \"defined\" or \"saved\" somewhere (whatever it means actually), but it is not authorized or able to use resources. Assuming an AI is made of hardware and software, it is like a program stored on a disk, but without permission to run. </p>\\n\\n<p>\"Dynamic Death\": Under the same characterization of AI as hardware and software, dynamic death is the invalidation of progress akin to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liveness\" rel=\"nofollow\">strong liveness properties</a>, where an AI is trapped in an infinite loop (or a void loop), in a form of \"active death\", as what happens to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sisyphus</a> in Greek mythology. This is different from static death, as the AI <em>still</em> uses dynamic resources, although it cannot make progress. Continuing under the same assumptions, such AI could be \"loaded\" in main memory, or locked waiting for inputs or outputs to complete.</p>\\n\\n<p>Note that in these two scenarios, <em>rebirth</em> is possible, and they also subsume that there is an entity that can <em>decide</em> conditions for rebirth, or preventing it completely. Would this entity be an \"admin\", a god, other AIs, or a human is another question, really.</p>\\n\\n<p>The terms \"death\" and \"rebirth\" here could just be changed for \"imprisoning\", where the dynamic version would be like our human prisons, and the static version would be like SciFi cryogeny. This is a bit of a stretch, but we can see an equivalence, and no good reason to qualify these two scenarios as deaths.</p>\\n\\n<p>In conclusion, death for AI seems to be an exceptional, singular scenario, so AI cannot die <em>in practice</em>, except if we are wrong on how we think we can make AGIs. AI can however be imprisoned <em>forever</em>.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>Note: The terminology above is completely made-up for the post. I do not have citations to back some claims, but it is based on readings and personal work (including in software verification).</p>\\n'),\n",

One is bodily continuity, which may actually require only that parts of the body stay in existence (i.e., the brain). Another is psychological continuity, which requires the continuance of your consciousness - by which is meant your thoughts, ideas, memories, plans, beliefs, and so on. The third possibility is the continued existence of some kind of immaterial part of you, which might be called the soul*. Of course, it may be the case that a combination of one or more types of these continuity is required for you to survive.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>The other answers assumes that life is based on \"psychological continuity\", and looks at what might disrupt this \"continuity\". I assume that life is based on \"bodily continuity\", which is much easier to disrupt - just <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_(command)\" rel=\"nofollow\">kill</a> the process...it doesn\\'t matter if a new process respawns...because the original process is still dead. By playing through <strong>\"Staying Alive\"</strong>, you will be able to work out your own personal definition of life and death. Once you have your own personal definition, then simply apply it to this specific case, either siding with \"psychological continuity\" (the other answers) or \"bodily continuity\" (my own opinion).</p>\\n\\n<p><sub>*If you assume that life requires a soul, well, it is not clear that AI would have souls. If they don\\'t (and this seems the most reasonable assumption here), then they obviously wouldn\\'t be alive (and you cannot die if you are not alive). If they <em>do</em> have souls though, then the other answers which assume \"psychological continuity\" may still be applicable, as it seems that the existence of a \"soul\" is dependent on \"psychological continuity\".</sub></p>\\n'),\n",

At all. We are not even close. We have absolutely NO IDEA how to bridge the gap between what we can do now and what is depicted in pop-culture films. Even with cars that drive themselves and computers that play 'Go' — an underachieving mosquito possesses more cognitive intelligence than all the world's super computers <em>…combined!</em></p>\\n<h3>…or possibly &quot;disqualified&quot; for cheating.</h3>\\n<p>Even if we could pre-format the questions in a style and delivery system it understands, what does memorization, attention, or speed mean in the context of a computer? I'm not even sure if a standardized IQ test makes sense in this context. It might be like asking how a computer would do in a spelling bee.</p>\\n<p>In human terms, we're not <em>allowed</em> to bring along reference materials to look up an answer; but how do you rectify that when reference-lookup is innate to a computer's existence? How do you measure memory when storage is non-volatile? This gets into an existential question about the nature of learning and knowledge vs. just taking a lot of notes.</p>\\n<p>Still, how do you even <em><strong>teach</strong></em> a computer what is meant by <em>&quot;which animal is least like the other four?&quot;</em> Did the computer really figure out what was being asked out of general intelligence, or is the computer simply designed to parse out IQ-style questions specifically? If you designed something with a foreknowledge of what would likely be asked, the computers of today <em>might</em> simply be able to &quot;recognize&quot; it as question-style 496.527b and plug in the variables.</p>\\n<p>But that's not <em>general intelligence</em> by any definition we use or understand. It's just a specialized, slick interpreter designed to parse out a specific type of standardized question.

This includes variants like Bidirectional, Jordan and Elman Networks. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a more sophisticated neural net algorithm which can accomplish the same time and sequence-based tasks, but which can leverage standard learning methods like backprop since it doesn\\'t suffer from the \"vanishing gradient problem.\" This is because LSTMs have been brilliantly engineered as \"perfect integrators,\" which makes it a lot easier to calculate the error gradients etc. over long periods of time. In contrast, learning with RNNs is still not theoretically well-grounded and is difficult to calculate through existing methods like Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT). In Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNNs), the idea is to add new neurons and connections with each new training example across a stretch of time or training sequence; unfortunately, this places a practical limitation on how many examples you can feed into the net before the size of the network gets out of hand or it starts forgetting, just as with RNNs. LSTMs have much longer memories (especially when augmented with Neural Turing Machines) so that\\'d be my first choice, assuming I wanted to use neural nets for NLP purposes. My knowledge of the subject is limited though (I\\'m still trying to learn the ropes) so there may be other important neural net algorithms I\\'m overlooking...</p>\\n'),\n",

              "               '<p>The short answer is that Hawkins\\' vision has yet to be implemented in a widely accessible way, particularly the indispensable parts related to prediction. </p>\\n\\n<p>The long answer is that I read Hawkins\\' book a few years ago and was excited by the possibilities of Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). I still am, despite the fact that I have a few reservations about some of his philosophical musings on the meanings of consciousness, free will and other such topics. I won\\'t elaborate on those misgivings here because they\\'re not germane to the main, overwhelming reason why HTM nets haven\\'t succeeded as much as expected to date: to my knowledge, Numenta has only implemented a truncated version of his vision. They left out most of the prediction architecture, which plays such a critical role in Hawkins\\' theories. As Gerod M. Bonhoff put it in <a href=\"http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a482820.pdf\">an excellent thesis</a><a href=\"http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a482820.pdf\">1</a> on HTMs, </p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>\"In March of 2007, Numenta released what they claimed was a “research\\n  implementation” of HTM theory called Numenta Platform for Intelligent\\n  Computing (NuPIC). The algorithm used by NuPIC at this time is called\\n  “Zeta1.” NuPIC was released as an open source software platform and\\n  binary files of the Zeta1 algorithm. Because of licensing, this paper\\n  is not allowed to discuss the proprietary implementation aspects of\\n  Numenta’s Zeta1 algorithm. There are, however, generalized\\n  concepts of implementation that can be discussed freely. The two most\\n  important of these are how the Zeta 1 algorithm (encapsulated in each\\n  memory node of the network hierarchy) implements HTM theory. To\\n  implement any theory in software, an algorithmic design for each\\n  aspect of the theory must be addressed. The most important design\\n  decision Numenta adopted was to eliminate feedback within the\\n  hierarchy and instead choose to simulate this theoretical concept\\n  using only data pooling algorithms for weighting. This decision is\\n  immediately suspect and violates key concepts of HTM. Feedback,\\n  Hawkins’ insists, is vital to cortical function and central to his\\n  theories. Still, Numenta claims that most HTM applicable problems can\\n  be solved using their implementation and proprietary pooling\\n  algorithms.\"</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>I am still learning the ropes in this field and cannot say whether or not Numenta has since scrapped this approach in favor of a full implementation of Hawkins\\' ideas, especially the all-important prediction architecture. Even if they have, this design decision has probably delayed adoption by many years. That\\'s not a criticism per se; perhaps the computational costs of tracking prediction values and updating them on the fly were too much to bear at the time, on top of the ordinary costs of processing neural nets, leaving them with no other path except to try half-measures like their proprietary pooling mechanisms. Nevertheless, all of the best research papers I\\'ve read on the topic since then have chosen to reimplement the algorithms rather than relying on Numenta\\'s platform, typically because of the missing prediction features. Cases in point include Bonhoff\\'s thesis and <a href=\"http://cogprints.org/9187/1/HTM_TR_v1.0.pdf\">Maltoni\\'s technical report for the University of Bologna Biometric System Laboratory</a><a href=\"http://cogprints.org/9187/1/HTM_TR_v1.0.pdf\">2</a>. In all of those cases, however, there is no readily accessible software for putting their variant HTMs to immediate use (as far as I know). The gist of all this is that like G.K. Chesterton\\'s famous maxim about Christianity, \"HTMs have not been tried and found wanting; they have been found difficult, and left untried.\" Since Numenta left out the prediction steps, I assume that they would be the main stumbling blocks awaiting anyone who wants to code Hawkins\\' full vision of what an HTM should be.</p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a482820.pdf\">1</a>Bonhoff, Gerod M., 2008, Using Hierarchical Temporal Memory for Detecting Anomalous Network Activity.

For example, the word vector for \"the man\", should be similar to the word vector for \"the man who mistook his wife for a hat\", because noun phrases act like nouns, etc. Often, you can use linguistic information to guide your recursion on the sentence.

We can have creative yet ethical problem-solving if the system has a complete system of ethics, but otherwise creativity will be unsafe by default.</p>\\n\\n<p>One can classify AI decision-making approaches into two types: interpolative thinkers, and extrapolative thinkers. </p>\\n\\n<p>Interpolative thinkers learn to classify and mimic whatever they\\'re learning from, and don\\'t try to give reasonable results outside of their training domain. You can think of them as interpolating between training examples, and benefitting from all of the mathematical guarantees and provisos as other statistical techniques.</p>\\n\\n<p>Extrapolative thinkers learn to manipulate underlying principles, which allows them to combine those principles in previously unconsidered ways. The relevant field for intuition here is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization\">numerical optimization</a>, of which the simplest and most famous example is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming\">linear programming</a>, rather than the statistical fields that birthed machine learning. You can think of them as extrapolating beyond training examples (indeed, many of them don\\'t even require training examples, or use those examples to infer underlying principles).</p>\\n\\n<p>The promise of extrapolative thinkers is that they can come up with these \\'lateral\\' solutions much more quickly than people would be able to. The problem with these extrapolative thinkers is that they only use the spoken principles, not any unspoken ones that might seem too obvious to mention.</p>\\n\\n<p>An attribute of solutions to optimization problems is that the feature vector is often \\'extreme\\' in some way. In linear programming, at least one vertex of the feasible solution space will be optimal, and so simple solution methods find an optimal vertex (which is almost infeasible by nature of being a vertex).</p>\\n\\n<p>As another example, the minimum-fuel solution for moving a spacecraft from one position to another is called \\'<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang%E2%80%93bang_control\">bang-bang</a>,\\' where you accelerate the craft as quickly as possible at the beginning and end of the trajectory, coasting at maximum speed in between.</p>\\n\\n<p>While a virtue when the system is correctly understood (bang-bang <em>is</em> optimal for many cases), this is catastrophic when the system is incorrectly understood. My favorite example here is <a href=\"https://resources.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/d1/teaching/ws14/Ideen-der-Informatik/Dantzig-Diet.pdf\">Dantzig\\'s diet problem</a> (discussion starts on page 5 of the pdf), where he tries to optimize his diet using math. Under his first constraint set, he\\'s supposed to drink 500 gallons of vinegar a day. Under his second, 200 bouillon cubes. Under his third, two pounds of bran. The considerations that make those obviously bad ideas aren\\'t baked into the system, and so the system innocently suggests them.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you can completely encode the knowledge and values that a person uses to judge these plans into the AI, then extrapolative systems are as safe as that person. They\\'ll be able to consider and reject the wrong sort of extreme plans, and leave you with the right sort of extreme plans.</p>\\n\\n<p>But if you can\\'t, then it does make sense to not build an extrapolative decision-maker, and instead build an interpolative one. That is, instead of asking itself \"how do I best accomplish goal X?\" it\\'s asking itself \"what would a person do in this situation?\". The latter might be much worse at accomplishing goal X, but it has much less of the tail risk of sacrificing other goals to accomplish X.</p>\\n'),\n",

It gives you the notion that in order to get achieve a better payoff, your goal is not actually making a better prediction but choosing the better options by considering what other players are doing. If you ask why it is not just the better prediction, the answer is that there is always a balance of risk and payoff and since you cannot find a 100% guaranteed way of prediction, you will have to balance risk and payoff in order to gain in the long run. In addition, although theory suggests that you can make a good prediction by gathering all variables, this is not really possible in practice.

Individual level AMGs can produce arbitrary machines for arbitrary purposes on human time-scales.</p>\\n\\n<p>The problem is that the simplest possible (and most general) AMG is a purely <em>random</em> machine generator. Any more specificity (and therefore complexity) to the AMG would constrain the domains it closes over. Which is fine, but optimizing a machine for a particular set of tasks means that you are <em>unoptimizing</em> the machine for some other particular set of tasks. Again, there\\'s no free context.</p>\\n\\n<p>Humans are AMGs, but we are only efficient at creating certain kinds of machines, using our imagination.

And, again, while human intelligence <em>is</em> an AMG, any given AMG that is optimized for generating machines of a particular type will be less optimized for generating machines of some other type(s). There\\'s no free context. The most general search algorithm is a random walk - there is no way to <em>improve</em> the generality of the random walk, other than just speeding it up.

Technology is rapidly advancing, and while I can think of situations where jobs can\\'t be killed in the short-term or even in the long-term, I can\\'t think of a job that is 100%, totally immune to extinction. Surely they <em>exist</em>, but you can\\'t be <em>sure</em>...anything can happen after all. As long as it\\'s <em>possible</em>, that\\'s what matters here. You can\\'t prove a negative.</p>\\n\\n<p>This whole question seems as foolhardy as predicting in the 1850s that airplanes would <em>never</em> be invented. You\\'d be right in assuming that airplanes would not be invented in the 1860s...or the 1870s...or even the 1880s...but eventually, airplanes would be invented.</p>\\n\\n<p>What would be better is to provide a specific cut-off point (\"will all jobs be automated by the year 2020?\") that can allow us to try to extrapolate and predict based on current trends, but even that starts being difficult as you extend the cut-off point - My predictions about 2020 will be more accurate than my prediction about 2220. I think this type of question is truly unanswerable and can quickly decay to science-fiction speculation.</p>\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n<p>Some additional comments about Doxosphoi\\'s answer:</p>\\n\\n<p>Doxosophoi made some arguments for why current society might not accept the automation of all jobs (the need for the \"personal touch\" that only a human-like intelligence can provide), but that\\'s no reason to assume that society will <em>never</em> accept automation. Technology can change and adapt, and humans can also change and adapt. Maybe a human might not care about a shrink who \"rubs its eyes in the morning\", dislike movies that are marred by that \"vagaries of humanity\" instead of personal customization, prefer politicians and soldiers that actually acts logically instead of acting like a falliable human, etc., etc. I mean, it\\'s <em>possible</em>.</p>\\n\\n<p>There\\'s also the problem of the term \"job\". Technically, I am working by writing an answer on a StackExchange website, but I\\'m not getting paid for it, so it\\'s not a real \"job\"...at best, it\\'s just a hobby. I\\'m providing a valuable human touch, but since no one is giving me money, it\\'s possible that this human touch may not be all that valuable in the first place: \"never give out your labor for free, because then they\\'ll take it for free\".</p>\\n\\n<p>Some of the techno-utopists (which I disagree with heavily) believes in a future where bots handle produce a lot of industrial goods and services, generating a lot of revenue that is then redistributed to the general population via some \"Basic Income\" scheme. This allows humans to do what they really want instead...such as hobbies? And what if the hobbies of the future are the \"jobs\" of today: shrinks, movie directors, politicians, soldiers, etc., etc. Instead of working for a paycheck, you\\'re working in these jobs on a volunteer basis.</p>\\n\\n<p>Obviously, no automation is being necessary to eliminate these hobbyists (no matter how good a bot is, <em>free labor</em> will always prevail), but they\\'re not really jobs, are they? The bot is the one that is producing real value, and subsidizing the hobbies of all these other people. The idea of a \"job\" itself could be in jeopardy.</p>\\n\\n<p>I don\\'t think this scenario is likely either (in fact, I\\'d probably think it\\'s just AI snake oil that will never actually happen). But it\\'s <em>possible</em> and that\\'s why I can\\'t dismiss it outright. It could happen, just that I don\\'t think it will.</p>\\n\\n<p>And finally, the question is asking about whether a job can be automated, not <em>whether it\\'s a good idea</em> to have it be automated, which is a completely different question. It\\'s possible that we can build machines that can automate everything, and choose as a society not to use them for a variety of different reasons (such as the reasons that Doxosophoi mentioned).</p>\\n'),\n",

However, those reasons seem to imply that the humans are making a mistake in &quot;discounting&quot; the behavior of AI programs...and that these AI programs might actually be  intelligent. I want to make an alternate argument, where the humans are making a mistake, but not in &quot;discounting&quot; the behavior of AI programs.</p>\\n<p>Consider the following situation. I want to build a machine that can do X (where X is some trait, like intelligence). I am able to evaluate intuitively whether a machine has that X criteria. But I don\\'t have a good definition of what X actually <em>is</em>. All I can do is identify whether something has X or not.</p>\\n<p>However, I think that people who has X can do Y. So if I build a machine that can do Y, then surely, I built a machine that has X.</p>\\n<p>After building the machine that can do Y, I examine it to see if my machine has X. And it does not. So my machine lacks X. And while a machine that can do Y is cool, what I really want is a machine that has X. I go back to the drawing board and think of a new idea to reach X.</p>\\n<p>After writing on the whiteboard for a couple of hours, I realize that people who has X can do Z. Of course! I try to build a new machine that can do Z, yes, if it can do Z, then it must have X.</p>\\n<p>After building the machine that can do Z, I check to see if it has X. It does not. And so I return back to the drawing board, and the cycle repeats and repeats...</p>\\n<p>Essentially, humans are attempting to determine whether an entity has intelligence via proxy measurements, but those proxy measurements are potentially faulty (as it is possible to meet those proxy measurements without ever actually having intelligence). Until we know how to define intelligence and design a test that can accurately measure it, it is very unlikely for us to build a machine that has intelligence. So the AI Effect occurs because humans don\\'t know how to define &quot;intelligence&quot;, not due to people dismissing programs as not being &quot;intelligent&quot;.</p>\\n<p>Is this argument valid or correct?

However, if we can formally specify all such behaviors, we wouldn't be using this thing to solve any novel problems, like curing cancer, as the formal specification for curing cancer would already have been pre-computed. If you can formally specify the behaviors of a thing that can discover something new, you can just compute the solution via the specification, without instantiating the behaviors at all!</p>\\n\\n<p>Once AI has reached a certain level of capability, it won't need to generate consciousnesses to derive optimal solutions.

Our\\napproach uses high-level, visual Statechart models to represent\\nbehaviour in a modular form; this allows for not only simplistic,\\nparameterbased variation in AI design, but also permits more complex\\nstructure-based approaches. We demonstrate our technique by applying\\nit to the task of generating a large number of individual AIs for\\ncomputer-controlled squirrels within the Mammoth <a href=\"http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/%7Ecdrage/papers/SOCS-TR-2011.1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a> framework for\\ngame research.

It is also generally ignored by researchers of Computational Creativity, who already have their own tests to evaluate creativity.</p>\\n\\n<p>Longer Answer:\\nAccording to Google Scholar, there are 10 references to the \"Lovelace Test 2.0\" paper. All of those references exist merely to point out that the Lovelace Test 2.0 exists. In fact, at least two of articles I consulted (<a href=\"http://philpapers.org/archive/NEGANA.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">A novel approach for identifying a human-like self-conscious behavior</a> and <a href=\"http://users.dsic.upv.es/~flip/EGPAI2016/papers/EGPAI_2016_paper_8.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">FraMoTEC: A Framework for Modular Task-Environment Construction for Evaluating Adaptive Control Systems</a>) proposed their <em>own</em> tests instead.</p>\\n\\n<p>One of the authors who wrote the FraMoTEC paper also wrote <a href=\"http://skemman.is/stream/get/1946/25590/58121/1/scs-thorarensen2016-thesis.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">his thesis on FraMoTEC</a>, and indirectly critiqued the Lovelace Test 2.0 and other similar such tests:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>The Piaget-MacGyver Room problem [Bringsjord and Licato, 2012], Lovelace Test 2.0 [Riedl, 2014] and Toy Box problem [Johnston, 2010] all come with the caveat of being defined very vaguely — these evaluation methods may be likely to come up with a reasonable evaluation for intelligence, but it is very difficult to compare two different agents (or controllers) that partake in the their own domain-specific evaluations, which is what frequently happens when agents are tailored to pass specific evaluations.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>Another major issue with the Lovelace Test 2.0 is that there is a proliferation of <em>other</em> tests to \"measure\" the creativity of AI. <a href=\"https://kar.kent.ac.uk/42374/1/jordanous-2011a.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Evaluating Evaluation: Assessing Progress in Computational Creativity Research</a>, published by \\nAnna Jordanous in 2011 (3 years <em>before</em> the invention of the Lovelace Test 2.0) analyzed research papers about AI creativity and wrote:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Of the 18 papers that applied creativity evaluation methodologies to evaluate their system’s creativity, no one methodology emerged as standard across the community. Colton’s creative tripod framework (<a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fd8b/d5bb76c94c4bfc34cb1fa244dc6bd4a8ca8e.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Colton 2008</a>) was used most often (6 uses), with 4 papers using Ritchie’s empirical criteria (<a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/06d8/3be9078b5c8933c3523f0e663fff1c61e3a0.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ritchie 2007</a>). </p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>That leaves <em>10</em> papers with miscellaneous creativity evaluation methods.</p>\\n\\n<p>The goal of \"Evaluating Evaluation\" was to standardize the process of evaluating creativity, to avoid the possibility of the field stagnating due to the proliferation of so many creativity tests.  Anna Jordanous still remained interested in evaluating creativity tests, publishing articles such as <a href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/34328583/Stepping_Back_to_Progress_Forwards-_Setting_Standards_for_Meta-Evaluation_of_Computational_Creativity.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1475893195&amp;Signature=ox0%2FOEkNUNjz5pQg0w%2FOgzHPCsM%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DStepping_Back_to_Progress_Forwards_Setti.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">\"Stepping Back to Progress Forwards: Setting Standards for Meta-Evaluation of Computational Creativity\"</a> and <a href=\"http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~map01mm/CC2015/AISB-CC2015-Proceedings.pdf#page=18\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Four PPPPerspectives on Computational Creativity</a>.</p>\\n\\n<p>\"Evaluating Evaluation\" does provide some commentary to explain the proliferation of systems to evaluate creativity:</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>\\n  <p>Evaluation standards are not easy to define. It is difficult to evaluate creativity and even more difficult to describe how we evaluate creativity, in human creativity as well as in computational creativity. In fact, even the very definition of creativity is problematic (Plucker, Beghetto, and Dow 2004). It is hard to identify what ’being creative’ entails, so there are no benchmarks or ground truths to measure against.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n\\n<p>The fact that so many tests of creativity already exist (to the extent that Jordanous can make an academic career in studying them) means that it\\'s very difficult for any new test (such as the Lovelace Test 2.0) to even be noticed (much less cited). Why would you want to use something like the Lovelace Test 2.0 when there\\'s so many other tests you could use instead?</p>\\n'),\n",

The definition of life in biological terms is the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic matter where the distinguishing criteria are the capacity for growth, reproduction, functional activity, and continual change preceding death. Does artificial intelligence \"grow\"?  Indeed, I can program a machine learning program to grow with every input taken in.  In the loosest sense, we can say that artificial intelligence does grow, but does it biologically? If we look at the definition for growth of a living thing, it means to undergo natural development by increasing in size and changing physically or the progress to maturity.  All living organisms undergo growth.   Even though at the simplest level, cells are a series of chemical processes, cells are a very complicated set of chemical processes that are still not fully understood by scientists across the world.  Every cell has genetic material that can be replicated, excised, used for RNA, proteins, and that is subject to epigenetic regulation. \\n<a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nczDU.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nczDU.png\" alt=\"Cell division\"></a></p>\\n\\n<p>Does artificial intelligence undergo the same process of cell division?  No.  If I wanted to, I could write a program that undergoes a simple for-loop (print i from 1 to 100), replicates itself at a certain point (i=50) to produce the same program perhaps with some variation that will execute itself, and terminates (dies) at the end of the for loop.  The program, by an extremely loose definition supported by philosophy but not by biology, lives.  However, in scientific terms (and the correct interpretation), artificial intelligence is not living.  Artificial intelligence can be seen to be similar to viruses which are considered to be acellular and essential to life but not living.  Viruses are encapsulated DNA and RNA that undergo processes of growth, reproduction, and functionality but because they lack the ability to undergo the cell division cycle, are considered non-living.  At the very basis of the scientific definition of life is the cell replication cycle.  Artificial intelligence and viruses are not able to undergo the cell cycle.  Viruses need to infect other cells in order to reproduce but do not have their own, autonomous cycle.  At the end of the day, if you can argue that viruses are alive, you can argue that artificial intelligence is alive as well.  For the scientific definition of life, artificial intelligence must undergo the process of cell division and replication.  Even though artificial intelligence can mimic and help sustain life, no artificial intelligence process is truly alive. </p>\\n\\n<p>Do note I did not discuss <a href=\"http://www.isss.org/primer/asem14ep.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">living systems</a> in my answer.          </p>\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21685/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Definition of life</a></p>\\n'),\n",

There is no existing example of this as of yet. The problem is that its internal model of reality needs to provide for every possible action. And it\\'s possible actions and reactions may not be limited to a finite number of discretely distinct moves as in a game of chess.

I think you guys are skipping the fact that the neural network only really is saying truly from a programmatic standpoint that \"this is most like\".</p>\\n\\n<p>For example, while we can list the above image examples as \"abstract art\", they definitively are most like was is listed. Remember learning algorithms have a scope on what they recognize as an object and if you look at all the above examples... and think about the scope of the algorithum... these make sense (even the ones at a glance we would recognize as white noise). In Vishnu example of the numbers, if you fuzz your eyes and bring the images out of focus, you can actually in every case spot patterns that really closely reflect the numbers in question.</p>\\n\\n<p>The problem that is being shown here is that the algorithm appears to not have a \"unknown case\". Basically when the pattern recognition says that it doesn\\'t exist in the output scope. (so a final output node group that says this is nothing that I know off). For example, people do this as well, as it\\'s one thing humans and learning algorithms have in common. Here\\'s a link to show what I\\'m talking about (what is the following, define it) using only known animals that exist:</p>\\n\\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AZwnpm.jpg\" alt=\"Picture link\"></p>\\n\\n<p>Now as a person, limited by what I know and can say, I\\'d have to conclude that the following is an elephant. But it\\'s not. Learning algorithms (for the most part) do not have a \"like a\" statement, the out put always validates down to a confidence percentage. So tricking one in this fashion is not surprising... what is of course surprising is that based on it\\'s knowledge set, it actually comes to the point in which, if you look at the above cases listed by OP and Vishnu that a person... with a little looking... can see how the learning algorithm probable made the association. </p>\\n\\n<p>So, I wouldn\\'t really call it a mislabel on the part of the algorithm, or even call it a case where it\\'s been tricked... rather a case where it\\'s scope was developed incorrectly.</p>\\n'),\n",
